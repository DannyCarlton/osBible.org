(1, 'A', 'Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, as Omega is thelast. These letters occur in the text of Rev. 1:8, 11; 21:6;22:13, and are represented by \"Alpha\" and \"Omega\" respectively(omitted in R.V., 1:11). They mean \"the first and last.\" (Comp.Heb. 12:2; Isa. 41:4; 44:6; Rev. 1:11, 17; 2:8.) In the symbolsof the early Christian Church these two letters are frequentlycombined with the cross or with Christ\'s monogram to denote hisdivinity.<br><br>'),
(2, 'Aaron', 'The eldest son of Amram and Jochebed, a daughter of Levi (Ex.6:20). Some explain the name as meaning mountaineer, othersmountain of strength, illuminator. He was born in Egypt threeyears before his brother Moses, and a number of years after hissister Miriam (2:1, 4; 7:7). He married Elisheba, the daughterof Amminadab of the house of Judah (6:23; 1 Chr. 2:10), by whomhe had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. When thetime for the deliverance of Isarael out of Egypt drew nigh, hewas sent by God (Ex. 4:14, 27-30) to meet his long-absentbrother, that he might co-operate with him in all that they wererequired to do in bringing about the Exodus. He was to be the\"mouth\" or \"prophet\" of Moses, i.e., was to speak for him,because he was a man of a ready utterance (7:1, 2, 9, 10, 19).He was faithful to his trust, and stood by Moses in all hisinterviews with Pharaoh.<br><br>When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with Amalekin Rephidim, Moses stood on a hill overlooking the scene of theconflict with the rod of God in his outstretched hand. On thisoccasion he was attended by Aaron and Hur, his sister\'s husband,who held up his wearied hands till Joshua and the chosenwarriors of Israel gained the victory (17:8-13).<br><br>Afterwards, when encamped before Sinai, and when Moses at thecommand of God ascended the mount to receive the tables of thelaw, Aaron and his two sons, Nadab and Abihu, along with seventyof the elders of Israel, were permitted to accompany him part ofthe way, and to behold afar off the manifestation of the gloryof Israel\'s God (Ex. 19:24; 24:9-11). While Moses remained onthe mountain with God, Aaron returned unto the people; andyielding through fear, or ignorance, or instability ofcharacter, to their clamour, made unto them a golden calf, andset it up as an object of worship (Ex. 32:4; Ps. 106:19). On thereturn of Moses to the camp, Aaron was sternly rebuked by himfor the part he had acted in this matter; but he interceded forhim before God, who forgave his sin (Deut. 9:20).<br><br>On the mount, Moses received instructions regarding the systemof worship which was to be set up among the people; and inaccordance therewith Aaron and his sons were consecrated to thepriest\'s office (Lev. 8; 9). Aaron, as high priest, heldhenceforth the prominent place appertaining to that office.<br><br>When Israel had reached Hazeroth, in \"the wilderness of Paran,\"Aaron joined with his sister Miriam in murmuring against Moses,\"because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married,\" probablyafter the death of Zipporah. But the Lord vindicated his servantMoses, and punished Miriam with leprosy (Num. 12). Aaronacknowledged his own and his sister\'s guilt, and at theintercession of Moses they were forgiven.<br><br>Twenty years after this, when the children of Israel wereencamped in the wilderness of Paran, Korah, Dathan, and Abiramconspired against Aaron and his sons; but a fearful judgmentfrom God fell upon them, and they were destroyed, and the nextday thousands of the people also perished by a fiercepestilence, the ravages of which were only stayed by theinterposition of Aaron (Num. 16). That there might be furtherevidence of the divine appointment of Aaron to the priestlyoffice, the chiefs of the tribes were each required to bring toMoses a rod bearing on it the name of his tribe. And these,along with the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi, were laid upovernight in the tabernacle, and in the morning it was foundthat while the other rods remained unchanged, that of Aaron \"forthe house of Levi\" budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds (Num.17:1-10). This rod was afterwards preserved in the tabernacle(Heb. 9:4) as a memorial of the divine attestation of hisappointment to the priesthood.<br><br>Aaron was implicated in the sin of his brother at Meribah (Num.20:8-13), and on that account was not permitted to enter thePromised Land. When the tribes arrived at Mount Hor, \"in theedge of the land of Edom,\" at the command of God Moses led Aaronand his son Eleazar to the top of that mountain, in the sight ofall the people. There he stripped Aaron of his priestlyvestments, and put them upon Eleazar; and there Aaron died onthe top of the mount, being 123 years old (Num. 20:23-29. Comp.Deut. 10:6; 32:50), and was \"gathered unto his people.\" Thepeople, \"even all the house of Israel,\" mourned for him thirtydays. Of Aaron\'s sons two survived him, Eleazar, whose familyheld the high-priesthood till the time of Eli; and Ithamar, inwhose family, beginning with Eli, the high-priesthood was heldtill the time of Solomon. Aaron\'s other two sons had been struckdead (Lev. 10:1, 2) for the daring impiety of offering \"strangefire\" on the alter of incense.<br><br>The Arabs still show with veneration the traditionary site ofAaron\'s grave on one of the two summits of Mount Hor, which ismarked by a Mohammedan chapel. His name is mentioned in theKoran, and there are found in the writings of the rabbins manyfabulous stories regarding him.<br><br>He was the first anointed priest. His descendants, \"the house ofAaron,\" constituted the priesthood in general. In the time ofDavid they were very numerous (1 Chr. 12:27). The other branchesof the tribe of Levi held subordinate positions in connectionwith the sacred office. Aaron was a type of Christ in hisofficial character as the high priest. His priesthood was a\"shadow of heavenly things,\" and was intended to lead the peopleof Israel to look forward to the time when \"another priest\"would arise \"after the order of Melchizedek\" (Heb. 6:20). (See[1]MOSES.)<br><br>'),
(3, 'Aaronites', 'The descendants of Aaron, and therefore priests. Jehoiada, thefather of Benaiah, led 3,700 Aaronites as \"fighting men\" to thesupport of David at Hebron (1 Chr. 12:27). Eleazar (Num. 3:32),and at a later period Zadok (1 Chr. 27:17), was their chief.<br><br>'),
(4, 'Abaddon', 'Destruction, the Hebrew name (equivalent to the Greek Apollyon,i.e., destroyer) of \"the angel of the bottomless pit\" (Rev.9:11). It is rendered \"destruction\" in Job 28:22; 31:12; 26:6;Prov. 15:11; 27:20. In the last three of these passages theRevised Version retains the word \"Abaddon.\" We may regard thisword as a personification of the idea of destruction, or assheol, the realm of the dead.<br><br>'),
(5, 'Abagtha', 'One of the seven eunuchs in Ahasuerus\'s court (Esther 1:10;2:21).<br><br>'),
(6, 'Abana', 'Stony (Heb. marg. \"Amanah,\" perennial), the chief river ofDamascus (2 Kings 5:12). Its modern name is Barada, theChrysorrhoas, or \"golden stream,\" of the Greeks. It rises in acleft of the Anti-Lebanon range, about 23 miles north-west ofDamascus, and after flowing southward for a little way partsinto three smaller streams, the central one flowing throughDamascus, and the other two on each side of the city, diffusingbeauty and fertility where otherwise there would be barrenness.<br><br>'),
(7, 'Abarim', 'Regions beyond; i.e., on the east of Jordan, a mountain, orrather a mountain-chain, over against Jericho, to the east andsouth-east of the Dead Sea, in the land of Moab. From \"the topof Pisgah\", i.e., Mount Nebo (q.v.), one of its summits, Mosessurveyed the Promised Land (Deut. 3:27; 32:49), and there hedied (34:1, 5). The Israelites had one of their encampments inthe mountains of Abarim (Num. 33:47, 48) after crossing theArnon.<br><br>'),
(8, 'Abba', 'This Syriac or Chaldee word is found three times in the NewTestament (Mark 14:36; Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6), and in each case isfollowed by its Greek equivalent, which is translated \"father.\"It is a term expressing warm affection and filial confidence. Ithas no perfect equivalent in our language. It has passed intoEuropean languages as an ecclesiastical term, \"abbot.\"<br><br>'),
(9, 'Abda', 'Servant. (1.) The father of Adoniram, whom Solomon set over thetribute (1 Kings 4:6); i.e., the forced labour (R.V., \"levy\").<br><br>(2.) A Levite of the family of Jeduthun (Neh. 11:17), alsocalled Obadiah (1 Chr. 9:16).<br><br>'),
(10, 'Abdeel', 'Servant of God, (Jer. 36:26), the father of Shelemiah.<br><br>'),
(11, 'Abdi', 'My servant. (1.) 1 Chr. 6:44. (2.) 2 Chr. 29:12. (3.) Ezra10:26.<br><br>'),
(12, 'Abdiel', 'Servant of God, (1 Chr. 5:15), a Gadite chief.<br><br>'),
(13, 'Abdon', 'Servile. (1.) The son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, the tenth judgeof Israel (Judg. 12:13-15). He is probably the Bedan of 1 Sam.12:11.<br><br>(2.) The first-born of Gibeon of the tribe of Benjamin (1 Chr.8:30; 9:36).<br><br>(3.) The son of Micah, one of those whom Josiah sent to theprophetess Huldah to ascertain from her the meaning of therecently discovered book of the law (2 Chr. 34:20). He is calledAchbor in 2 Kings 22:12.<br><br>(4.) One of the \"sons\" of Shashak (1 Chr. 8:23).<br><br>This is the name also of a Levitical town of the Gershonites, inthe tribe of Asher (Josh. 21:30; 1 Chr. 6:74). The ruins ofAbdeh, some 8 miles north-east of Accho, probably mark its site.<br><br>'),
(14, 'Abednego', 'Servant of Nego=Nebo, the Chaldee name given to Azariah, one ofDaniel\'s three companions (Dan. 2:49). With Shadrach andMeshach, he was delivered from the burning fiery furnace(3:12-30).<br><br>'),
(15, 'Abel', '(Heb. Hebhel), a breath, or vanity, the second son of Adam andEve. He was put to death by his brother Cain (Gen. 4:1-16).Guided by the instruction of their father, the two brothers weretrained in the duty of worshipping God. \"And in process of time\"(marg. \"at the end of days\", i.e., on the Sabbath) each of themoffered up to God of the first-fruits of his labours. Cain, as ahusbandman, offered the fruits of the field; Abel, as ashepherd, of the firstlings of his flock. \"The Lord had respectunto Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and his offering hehad not respect\" (Gen. 4:3-5). On this account Cain was angrywith his brother, and formed the design of putting him to death;a design which he at length found an opportunity of carryinginto effect (Gen. 4:8, 9. Comp. 1 John 3:12). There are severalreferences to Abel in the New Testament. Our Saviour speaks ofhim as \"righteous\" (Matt. 23:35). \"The blood of sprinkling\" issaid to speak \"better things than that of Abel\" (Heb. 12:24);i.e., the blood of Jesus is the reality of which the blood ofthe offering made by Abel was only the type. The comparison hereis between the sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered byAbel, and not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy andthe blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as hassometimes been supposed. It is also said (Heb. 11:4) that \"Abeloffered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.\" Thissacrifice was made \"by faith;\" this faith rested in God, notonly as the Creator and the God of providence, but especially inGod as the great Redeemer, whose sacrifice was typified by thesacrifices which, no doubt by the divine institution, wereoffered from the days of Adam downward. On account of that\"faith\" which looked forward to the great atoning sacrifice,Abel\'s offering was accepted of God. Cain\'s offering had no suchreference, and therefore was rejected. Abel was the firstmartyr, as he was the first of our race to die.<br><br>Abel (Heb. abhel), lamentation (1 Sam. 6:18), the name given tothe great stone in Joshua\'s field whereon the ark was \"setdown.\" The Revised Version, however, following the Targum andthe LXX., reads in the Hebrew text \'ebhen (= a stone), andaccordingly translates \"unto the great stone, whereon they setdown the ark.\" This reading is to be preferred.<br><br>Abel (Heb. abhel), a grassy place, a meadow. This word entersinto the composition of the following words:<br><br>'),
(16, 'Abel-beth-maachah', 'Meadow of the house of Maachah, a city in the north ofPalestine, in the neighbourhood of Dan and Ijon, in the tribe ofNaphtali. It was a place of considerable strength andimportance. It is called a \"mother in Israel\", i.e., ametropolis (2 Sam. 20:19). It was besieged by Joab (2 Sam.20:14), by Benhadad (1 Kings 15:20), and by Tiglath-pileser (2Kings 15:29) about B.C. 734. It is elsewhere called Abel-maim,meadow of the waters, (2 Chr. 16:4). Its site is occupied by themodern Abil or Abil-el-kamh, on a rising ground to the east ofthe brook Derdarah, which flows through the plain of Huleh intothe Jordan, about 6 miles to the west-north-west of Dan.<br><br>'),
(17, 'Abel-cheramim', '(Judg. 11:33, R.V.; A. V., \"plain of the vineyards\"), a villageof the Ammonites, whither Jephthah pursued their forces.<br><br>'),
(18, 'Abel-meholah', 'Meadow of dancing, or the dancing-meadow, the birth-place andresidence of the prophet Elisha, not far from Beth-shean (1Kings 4:12), in the tribe of Issachar, near where the Wadyel-Maleh emerges into the valley of the Jordan, \"the richmeadow-land which extends about 4 miles south of Beth-shean;moist and luxuriant.\" Here Elisha was found at his plough byElijah on his return up the Jordan valley from Horeb (1 Kings19:16). It is now called Ain Helweh.<br><br>'),
(19, 'Abel-mizraim', 'Meadow of Egypt, or mourning of Egypt, a place \"beyond,\" i.e.,on the west of Jordan, at the \"threshing-floor of Atad.\" Herethe Egyptians mourned seventy days for Jacob (Gen. 50:4-11). Itssite is unknown.<br><br>'),
(20, 'Abel-shittim', 'Meadow of the acacias, frequently called simply \"Shittim\" (Num.25:1; Josh. 2:1; Micah 6:5), a place on the east of Jordan, inthe plain of Moab, nearly opposite Jericho. It was theforty-second encampment of the Israelites, their lastresting-place before they crossed the Jordan (Num. 33:49; 22:1;26:3; 31:12; comp. 25:1; 31:16).<br><br>'),
(21, 'Abez', 'Tin, or white, a town in the tribe of Issachar (Josh. 19:20), atthe north of the plain of Esdraelon. It is probably identifiedwith the ruins of el-Beida.<br><br>'),
(22, 'Abia', 'My father is the Lord, the Greek form of Abijah, or Abijam(Matt. 1:7), instead of Abiah (1 Chr. 7:8). In Luke 1:5, thename refers to the head of the eighth of the twenty-four coursesinto which David divided the priests (1 Chr. 24:10).<br><br>'),
(23, 'Abi-albon', 'Father of strength; i.e., \"valiant\", one of David\'s body-guardof thirty mighty men (2 Sam. 23:31); called also Abiel (1 Chr.11:32).<br><br>'),
(24, 'Abiasaph', 'Father of gathering; the gatherer, the youngest of the threesons of Korah the Levite, head of a family of Korhites (Ex.6:24); called Ebisaph (1 Chr. 6:37).<br><br>'),
(25, 'Abiathar', 'Father of abundance, or my father excels, the son of Ahimelechthe high priest. He was the tenth high priest, and the fourth indescent from Eli. When his father was slain with the priests ofNob, he escaped, and bearing with him the ephod, he joinedDavid, who was then in the cave of Adullam (1 Sam. 22:20-23;23:6). He remained with David, and became priest of the party ofwhich he was the leader (1 Sam. 30:7). When David ascended thethrone of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest (1 Chr.15:11; 1 Kings 2:26) and the \"king\'s companion\" (1 Chr. 27:34).Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made highpriest. These appointments continued in force till the end ofDavid\'s reign (1 Kings 4:4). Abiathar was deposed (the solehistorical instance of the deposition of a high priest) andbanished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he tookpart in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. Thepriesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar (1 Sam.2:30-36; 1 Kings 1:19; 2:26, 27). Zadok now became sole highpriest. In Mark 2:26, reference is made to an occurrence in \"thedays of Abiathar the high priest.\" But from 1 Sam. 22, we learnexplicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the fatherof Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy issatisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark asreferring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term ofhis holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Markthat he was actual high priest at the time referred to. Others,however, think that the loaves belonged to Abiathar, who was atthat time (Lev. 24:9) a priest, and that he either himself gavethem to David, or persuaded his father to give them.<br><br>'),
(26, 'Abib', 'An ear of corn, the month of newly-ripened grain (Ex. 13:4;23:15); the first of the Jewish ecclesiastical year, and theseventh of the civil year. It began about the time of the vernalequinox, on 21st March. It was called Nisan, after the Captivity(Neh. 2:1). On the fifteenth day of the month, harvest was begunby gathering a sheaf of barley, which was offered unto the Lordon the sixteenth (Lev. 23:4-11).<br><br>'),
(27, 'Abida', 'Or Abi\'dah, father of knowledge; knowing, one of the five sonsof Midian, who was the son of Abraham by Keturah (1 Chr. 1:33),and apparently the chief of an Arab tribe.<br><br>'),

(29, 'Abieezer', 'Father of help; i.e., \"helpful.\" (1.) The second of the threesons of Hammoleketh, the sister of Gilead. He was the grandsonof Manasseh (1 Chr. 7:18). From his family Gideon sprang (Josh.17:2; comp. Judg. 6:34; 8:2). He was also called Jeezer (Num.26:30).<br><br>(2.) One of David\'s thirty warriors (2 Sam. 23:27; comp. 1 Chr.27:12).<br><br>(3.) The prince of the tribe of Dan at the Exodus (Num. 1:12).<br><br>'),

In 1 Sam. 9:1, he is called the\"father,\" probably meaning the grandfather, of Kish. (2.) AnArbathite, one of David\'s warriors (1 Chr. 11:32); called alsoAbi-albon (2 Sam. 23:31).<br><br>'),
(31, 'Abiezrite', 'Father of help, a descendant of Abiezer (Judg. 6:11, 24; 8:32).<br><br>'),
(32, 'Abigail', 'Father (i.e., \"leader\") of the dance, or \"of joy.\" (1.) Thesister of David, and wife of Jether an Ishmaelite (1 Chr. 2:16,17). She was the mother of Amasa (2 Sam. 17:25).<br><br>(2.) The wife of the churlish Nabal, who dwelt in the districtof Carmel (1 Sam. 25:3). She showed great prudence and delicatemanagement at a critical period of her husband\'s life. She was\"a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance.\"After Nabal\'s death she became the wife of David (1 Sam.25:14-42), and was his companion in all his future fortunes (1Sam. 27:3; 30:5; 2 Sam. 2:2). By her David had a son calledChileab (2 Sam. 3:3), elsewhere called Daniel (1 Chr. 3:1).<br><br>'),
(33, 'Abihail', 'Father of might. (1.) Num. 3:35. (2.) 1 Chr. 2:29. (3.) 1 Chr.5:14.<br><br>(4.) The second wife of King Rehoboam (2 Chr. 11:18), adescendant of Eliab, David\'s eldest brother.<br><br>(5.) The father of Esther and uncle of Mordecai (Esther 2:15).<br><br>'),
(34, 'Abihu', 'Father of Him; i.e., \"worshipper of God\", the second of the sonsof Aaron (Ex. 6:23; Num. 3:2; 26:60; 1 Chr. 6:3). Along with histhree brothers he was consecrated to the priest\'s office (Ex.28:1). With his father and elder brother he accompanied theseventy elders part of the way up the mount with Moses (Ex.24:1, 9). On one occasion he and Nadab his brother offeredincense in their censers filled with \"strange\" (i.e., common)fire, i.e., not with fire taken from the great brazen altar(Lev. 6:9, etc.), and for this offence they were struck dead,and were taken out and buried without the camp (Lev. 10:1-11;comp. Num. 3:4; 26:61; 1 Chr. 24:2). It is probable that whenthey committed this offence they were intoxicated, forimmediately after is given the law prohibiting the use of wineor strong drink to the priests.<br><br>'),
(35, 'Abihud', 'Father (i.e., \"possessor\") of renown. (1.) One of the sons ofBela, the son of Benjamin (1 Chr. 8:3); called also Ahihud (ver.7).<br><br>(2.) A descendant of Zerubbabel and father of Eliakim (Matt.1:13, \"Abiud\"); called also Juda (Luke 3:26), and Obadiah (1Chr. 3:21).<br><br>'),
(36, 'Abijah', 'Father (i.e., \"possessor or worshipper\") of Jehovah. (1.) 1 Chr.7:8. (2.) 1 Chr. 2:24.<br><br>(3.) The second son of Samuel (1 Sam. 8:2; 1 Chr. 6:28). Hisconduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge inBeer-sheba, to which office his father had appointed him, led topopular discontent, and ultimately provoked the people to demanda royal form of government.<br><br>(4.) A descendant of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, a chief of oneof the twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was dividedby David (1 Chr. 24:10). The order of Abijah was one of thosewhich did not return from the Captivity (Ezra 2:36-39; Neh.7:39-42; 12:1).<br><br>(5.) The son of Rehoboam, whom he succeeded on the throne ofJudah (1 Chr. 3:10). He is also called Abijam (1 Kings 14:31;15:1-8). He began his three years\' reign (2 Chr. 12:16; 13:1, 2)with a strenuous but unsuccessful effort to bring back the tentribes to their allegiance. His address to \"Jeroboam and allIsrael,\" before encountering them in battle, is worthy of beingspecially noticed (2 Chr. 13:5-12). It was a very bloody battle,no fewer than 500,000 of the army of Israel having perished onthe field. He is described as having walked \"in all the sins ofhis father\" (1 Kings 15:3; 2 Chr. 11:20-22). It is said in 1Kings 15:2 that \"his mother\'s name was Maachah, the daughter ofAbishalom;\" but in 2 Chr. 13:2 we read, \"his mother\'s name wasMichaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.\" The explanation isthat Maachah is just a variation of the name Michaiah, and thatAbishalom is probably the same as Absalom, the son of David. Itis probable that \"Uriel of Gibeah\" married Tamar, the daughterof Absalom (2 Sam. 14:27), and by her had Maachah. The word\"daughter\" in 1 Kings 15:2 will thus, as it frequently elsewheredoes, mean grand-daughter.<br><br>(6.) A son of Jeroboam, the first king of Israel. On account ofhis severe illness when a youth, his father sent his wife toconsult the prophet Ahijah regarding his recovery. The prophet,though blind with old age, knew the wife of Jeroboam as soon asshe approached, and under a divine impulse he announced to herthat inasmuch as in Abijah alone of all the house of Jeroboamthere was found \"some good thing toward the Lord,\" he only wouldcome to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the thresholdof the door on her return, the youth died, and \"all Israelmourned for him\" (1 Kings 14:1-18).<br><br>(7.) The daughter of Zechariah (2 Chr. 29:1; comp. Isa. 8:2),and afterwards the wife of Ahaz. She is also called Abi (2 Kings18:2).<br><br>(8.) One of the sons of Becher, the son of Benjamin (1 Chr.7:8). \"Abiah,\" A.V.<br><br>'),
(37, 'Abijam', 'Father of the sea; i.e., \"seaman\" the name always used in Kingsof the king of Judah, the son of Rehoboam, elsewhere calledAbijah (1 Kings 15:1, 7, 8). (See [2]ABIJAH.)<br><br>'),

(1.)The Philistine king of Gerar in the time of Abraham (Gen.20:1-18). By an interposition of Providence, Sarah was deliveredfrom his harem, and was restored to her husband Abraham. As amark of respect he gave to Abraham valuable gifts, and offeredhim a settlement in any part of his country; while at the sametime he delicately and yet severely rebuked him for havingpractised a deception upon him in pretending that Sarah was onlyhis sister. Among the gifts presented by the king were athousand pieces of silver as a \"covering of the eyes\" for Sarah;i.e., either as an atoning gift and a testimony of her innocencein the sight of all, or rather for the purpose of procuring aveil for Sarah to conceal her beauty, and thus as a reproof toher for not having worn a veil which, as a married woman, sheought to have done. A few years after this Abimelech visitedAbraham, who had removed southward beyond his territory, andthere entered into a league of peace and friendship with him.This league was the first of which we have any record. It wasconfirmed by a mutual oath at Beer-sheba (Gen. 21:22-34).<br><br>(2.) A king of Gerar in the time of Isaac, probably the son ofthe preceeding (Gen. 26:1-22). Isaac sought refuge in histerritory during a famine, and there he acted a part withreference to his wife Rebekah similar to that of his fatherAbraham with reference to Sarah. Abimelech rebuked him for thedeception, which he accidentally discovered. Isaac settled for awhile here, and prospered. Abimelech desired him, however, toleave his territory, which Isaac did. Abimelech afterwardsvisited him when he was encamped at Beer-sheba, and expressed adesire to renew the covenant which had been entered into betweentheir fathers (Gen. 26:26-31).<br><br>(3.) A son of Gideon (Judg. 9:1), who was proclaimed king afterthe death of his father (Judg. 8:33-9:6). One of his first actswas to murder his brothers, seventy in number, \"on one stone,\"at Ophrah. Only one named Jotham escaped. He was anunprincipled, ambitious ruler, often engaged in war with his ownsubjects. When engaged in reducing the town of Thebez, which hadrevolted, he was struck mortally on his head by a mill-stone,thrown by the hand of a woman from the wall above. Perceivingthat the wound was mortal, he desired his armour-bearer tothrust him through with his sword, that it might not be said hehad perished by the hand of a woman (Judg. 9:50-57).<br><br>(4.) The son of Abiathar, and high priest in the time of David(1 Chr. 18:16). In the parallel passage, 2 Sam. 8:17, we havethe name Ahimelech, and Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech. Thismost authorities consider the more correct reading. (5.) Achish,king of Gath, in the title of Ps. 34. (Comp. 1 Sam. 21:10-15.)<br><br>'),
(41, 'Abinadab', 'Father of nobleness; i.e., \"noble.\" (1.) A Levite ofKirjath-jearim, in whose house the ark of the covenant wasdeposited after having been brought back from the land of thePhilistines (1 Sam. 7:1). It remained there twenty years, tillit was at length removed by David (1 Sam. 7:1, 2; 1 Chr. 13:7).<br><br>(2.) The second of the eight sons of Jesse (1 Sam. 16:8). He waswith Saul in the campaign against the Philistines in whichGoliath was slain (1 Sam. 17:13).<br><br>(3.) One of Saul\'s sons, who peristed with his father in thebattle of Gilboa (1 Sam. 31:2; 1 Chr. 10:2).<br><br>(4.) One of Solomon\'s officers, who \"provided victuals for theking and his household.\" He presided, for this purpose, over thedistrict of Dor (1 Kings 4:11).<br><br>'),

Heand all the conspirators, with their families and possessions(except the children of Korah), were swallowed up by anearthquake (Num. 16:1-27; 26:9; Ps. 106:17).<br><br>(2.) The eldest son of Hiel the Bethelite, who perishedprematurely in consequence of his father\'s undertaking torebuild Jericho (1 Kings 16:34), according to the words ofJoshua (6:26). (See [3]JERICHO.)<br><br>'),
(44, 'Abishag', 'Father of (i.e., \"given to\") error, a young woman of Shunem,distinguished for her beauty. She was chosen to minister toDavid in his old age. She became his wife (1 Kings 1:3, 4, 15).After David\'s death Adonijah persuaded Bathsheba, Solomon\'smother, to entreat the king to permit him to marry Abishag.Solomon suspected in this request an aspiration to the throne,and therefore caused him to be put to death (1 Kings 2:17-25).<br><br>'),
(45, 'Abishai', 'Father of (i.e., \"desirous of\") a gift, the eldest son ofZeruiah, David\'s sister. He was the brother of Joab and Asahel(2 Sam. 2:18; 1 Chr. 2:16). Abishai was the only one whoaccompanied David when he went to the camp of Saul and took thespear and the cruse of water from Saul\'s bolster (1 Sam.26:5-12). He had the command of one of the three divisions ofDavid\'s army at the battle with Absalom (2 Sam. 18:2, 5, 12). Heslew the Philistine giant Ishbi-benob, who threatened David\'slife (2 Sam. 21:15-17). He was the chief of the second rank ofthe three \"mighties\" (2 Sam. 23:18, 19; 1 Chr. 11:20, 21); andon one occasion withstood 300 men, and slew them with his ownspear (2 Sam. 23:18). Abishai is the name of the Semitic chiefwho offers gifts to the lord of Beni-Hassan. See illustrationfacing page 10.<br><br>'),
(46, 'Abishua', 'Father of welfare; i.e., \"fortunate.\" (1.) The grandson ofBenjamin (1 Chr. 8:4).<br><br>(2.) The son of Phinehas the high priest (1 Chr. 6:4, 5, 50;Ezra 7:5).<br><br>'),

(49, 'Abitub', 'Father of goodness, a Benjamite (1 Chr. 8:11).<br><br>'),
(50, 'Abjects', '(Ps. 35:15), the translation of a Hebrew word meaning smiters;probably, in allusion to the tongue, slanderers. (Comp. Jer.18:18.)<br><br>'),
(51, 'Ablution', 'Or washing, was practised, (1.) When a person was initiated intoa higher state: e.g., when Aaron and his sons were set apart tothe priest\'s office, they were washed with water previous totheir investiture with the priestly robes (Lev. 8:6).<br><br>(2.) Before the priests approached the altar of God, they wererequired, on pain of death, to wash their hands and their feetto cleanse them from the soil of common life (Ex. 30:17-21). Tothis practice the Psalmist alludes, Ps. 26:6.<br><br>(3.) There were washings prescribed for the purpose of cleansingfrom positive defilement contracted by particular acts. Of suchwashings eleven different species are prescribed in theLevitical law (Lev. 12-15).<br><br>(4.) A fourth class of ablutions is mentioned, by which a personpurified or absolved himself from the guilt of some particularact. For example, the elders of the nearest village where somemurder was committed were required, when the murderer wasunknown, to wash their hands over the expiatory heifer which wasbeheaded, and in doing so to say, \"Our hands have not shed thisblood, neither have our eyes seen it\" (Deut. 21:1-9). So alsoPilate declared himself innocent of the blood of Jesus bywashing his hands (Matt. 27:24). This act of Pilate may not,however, have been borrowed from the custom of the Jews. Thesame practice was common among the Greeks and Romans.<br><br>The Pharisees carried the practice of ablution to great excess,thereby claiming extraordinary purity (Matt. 23:25). Mark(7:1-5) refers to the ceremonial ablutions. The Pharisees washedtheir hands \"oft,\" more correctly, \"with the fist\" (R.V.,\"diligently\"), or as an old father, Theophylact, explains it,\"up to the elbow.\" (Compare also Mark 7:4; Lev. 6:28; 11: 32-36;15:22) (See [4]WASHING.)<br><br>'),
(52, 'Abner', 'Father of light; i.e., \"enlightening\", the son of Ner and uncleof Saul. He was commander-in-chief of Saul\'s army (1 Sam. 14:50;17:55; 20:25). He first introduced David to the court of Saulafter the victory over Goliath (1 Sam. 17:57). After the deathof Saul, David was made king over Judah, and reigned in Hebron.Among the other tribes there was a feeling of hostility toJudah; and Abner, at the head of Ephraim, fostered thishostility in the interest of the house of Saul, whose sonIsh-bosheth he caused to be proclaimed king (2 Sam. 2:8). Astate of war existed between these two kings. A battle fatal toAbner, who was the leader of Ish-boseth\'s army, was fought withDavid\'s army under Joab at Gibeon (2 Sam. 2:12). Abner, escapingfrom the field, was overtaken by Asahel, who was \"light of footas a wild roe,\" the brother of Joab and Abishai, whom he thrustthrough with a back stroke of his spear (2 Sam. 2: 18-32).<br><br>Being rebuked by Ish-bosheth for the impropriety of taking towife Rizpah, who had been a concubine of King Saul, he found anexcuse for going over to the side of David, whom he nowprofessed to regard as anointed by the Lord to reign over allIsrael. David received him favourably, and promised that hewould have command of the armies. At this time Joab was absentfrom Hebron, but on his return he found what had happened. Abnerhad just left the city; but Joab by a stratagem recalled him,and meeting him at the gate of the city on his return, thrusthim through with his sword (2 Sam. 3:27, 31-39; 4:12. Comp. 1Kings 2:5, 32). David lamented in pathetic words the death ofAbner, \"Know ye not that there is a prince and a great manfallen this day in Israel?\" (2 Sam. 3:33-38.)<br><br>'),
(53, 'Abomination', 'This word is used, (1.) To express the idea that the Egyptiansconsidered themselves as defiled when they ate with strangers(Gen. 43:32). The Jews subsequently followed the same practice,holding it unlawful to eat or drink with foreigners (John 18:28;Acts 10:28; 11:3).<br><br>(2.) Every shepherd was \"an abomination\" unto the Egyptians(Gen. 46:34). This aversion to shepherds, such as the Hebrews,arose probably from the fact that Lower and Middle Egypt hadformerly been held in oppressive subjection by a tribe of nomadshepherds (the Hyksos), who had only recently been expelled, andpartly also perhaps from this other fact that the Egyptiansdetested the lawless habits of these wandering shepherds.<br><br>(3.) Pharaoh was so moved by the fourth plague, that while herefused the demand of Moses, he offered a compromise, grantingto the Israelites permission to hold their festival and offertheir sacrifices in Egypt. This permission could not beaccepted, because Moses said they would have to sacrifice \"theabomination of the Egyptians\" (Ex. 8:26); i.e., the cow or ox,which all the Egyptians held as sacred, and which they regardedit as sacrilegious to kill.<br><br>(4.) Daniel (11:31), in that section of his prophecies which isgenerally interpreted as referring to the fearful calamitiesthat were to fall on the Jews in the time of AntiochusEpiphanes, says, \"And they shall place the abomination thatmaketh desolate.\" Antiochus Epiphanes caused an altar to beerected on the altar of burnt-offering, on which sacrifices wereoffered to Jupiter Olympus. (Comp. 1 Macc. 1:57). This was theabomination of the desolation of Jerusalem. The same language isemployed in Dan. 9:27 (comp. Matt. 24:15), where the referenceis probably to the image-crowned standards which the Romans setup at the east gate of the temple (A.D. 70), and to which theypaid idolatrous honours. \"Almost the entire religion of theRoman camp consisted in worshipping the ensign, swearing by theensign, and in preferring the ensign before all other gods.\"These ensigns were an \"abomination\" to the Jews, the\"abomination of desolation.\"<br><br>This word is also used symbolically of sin in general (Isa.66:3); an idol (44:19); the ceremonies of the apostate Church ofRome (Rev. 17:4); a detestable act (Ezek. 22:11).<br><br>'),
(54, 'Abraham', 'Father of a multitude, son of Terah, named (Gen. 11:27) beforehis older brothers Nahor and Haran, because he was the heir ofthe promises. Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among hiskindred in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with hisfather and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, inwhich he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north toHaran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migrationwas a call from God (Acts 7:2-4). There is no mention of thisfirst call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however, in Gen.12. While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205years. Abram now received a second and more definite call,accompanied by a promise from God (Gen. 12:1, 2); whereupon hetook his departure, taking his nephew Lot with him, \"not knowingwhither he went\" (Heb. 11:8). He trusted implicitly to theguidance of Him who had called him.<br><br>Abram now, with a large household of probably a thousand souls,entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents. Passing alongthe valley of the Jabbok, in the land of Canaan, he formed hisfirst encampment at Sichem (Gen. 12:6), in the vale or oak-groveof Moreh, between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south.Here he received the great promise, \"I will make of thee a greatnation,\" etc. (Gen. 12:2, 3, 7). This promise comprehended notonly temporal but also spiritual blessings. It implied that hewas the chosen ancestor of the great Deliverer whose coming hadbeen long ago predicted (Gen. 3:15). Soon after this, for somereason not mentioned, he removed his tent to the mountaindistrict between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns abouttwo miles apart, where he built an altar to \"Jehovah.\" He againmoved into the southern tract of Palestine, called by theHebrews the Negeb; and was at length, on account of a famine,compelled to go down into Egypt. This took place in the time ofthe Hyksos, a Semitic race which now held the Egyptians inbondage. Here occurred that case of deception on the part ofAbram which exposed him to the rebuke of Pharaoh (Gen. 12:18).Sarai was restored to him; and Pharaoh loaded him with presents,recommending him to withdraw from the country. He returned toCanaan richer than when he left it, \"in cattle, in silver, andin gold\" (Gen. 12:8; 13:2. Comp. Ps. 105:13, 14). The wholeparty then moved northward, and returned to their previousstation near Bethel. Here disputes arose between Lot\'s shepherdsand those of Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generouslygave Lot his choice of the pasture-ground. (Comp. 1 Cor. 6:7.)He chose the well-watered plain in which Sodom was situated, andremoved thither; and thus the uncle and nephew were separated.Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a repetition of thepromises already made to him, and then removed to the plain or\"oak-grove\" of Mamre, which is in Hebron. He finally settledhere, pitching his tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree,called \"the oak of Mamre\" (Gen. 13:18). This was his thirdresting-place in the land.<br><br>Some fourteen years before this, while Abram was still inChaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King ofElam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities in theplain to which Lot had removed. This tribute was felt by theinhabitants of these cities to be a heavy burden, and aftertwelve years they revolted. This brought upon them the vengeanceof Chedorlaomer, who had in league with him four other kings. Heravaged the whole country, plundering the towns, and carryingthe inhabitants away as slaves. Among those thus treated wasLot. Hearing of the disaster that had fallen on his nephew,Abram immediately gathered from his own household a band of 318armed men, and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner,and Eshcol, he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him nearthe springs of the Jordan. They attacked and routed his army,and pursued it over the range of Anti-Libanus as far as toHobah, near Damascus, and then returned, bringing back all thespoils that had been carried away. Returning by way of Salem,i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place, Melchizedek, came forthto meet them with refreshments. To him Abram presented a tenthof the spoils, in recognition of his character as a priest ofthe most high God (Gen. 14:18-20).<br><br>In a recently-discovered tablet, dated in the reign of thegrandfather of Amraphel (Gen. 14:1), one of the witnesses iscalled \"the Amorite, the son of Abiramu,\" or Abram.<br><br>Having returned to his home at Mamre, the promises already madeto him by God were repeated and enlarged (Gen. 13:14). \"The wordof the Lord\" (an expression occurring here for the first time)\"came to him\" (15:1). He now understood better the future thatlay before the nation that was to spring from him. Sarai, nowseventy-five years old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram totake Hagar, her Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending thatwhatever child might be born should be reckoned as her own.Ishmael was accordingly thus brought up, and was regarded as theheir of these promises (Gen. 16). When Ishmael was thirteenyears old, God again revealed yet more explicitly and fully hisgracious purpose; and in token of the sure fulfilment of thatpurpose the patriarch\'s name was now changed from Abram toAbraham (Gen. 17:4, 5), and the rite of circumcision wasinstituted as a sign of the covenant. It was then announced thatthe heir to these covenant promises would be the son of Sarai,though she was now ninety years old; and it was directed thathis name should be Isaac. At the same time, in commemoration ofthe promises, Sarai\'s name was changed to Sarah. On thatmemorable day of God\'s thus revealing his design, Abraham andhis son Ishmael and all the males of his house were circumcised(Gen. 17). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his tentdoor, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his profferedhospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree, partook of the farewhich Abraham and Sarah provided. One of the three visitants wasnone other than the Lord, and the other two were angels in theguise of men. The Lord renewed on this occasion his promise of ason by Sarah, who was rebuked for her unbelief. Abrahamaccompanied the three as they proceeded on their journey. Thetwo angels went on toward Sodom; while the Lord tarried behindand talked with Abraham, making known to him the destructionthat was about to fall on that guilty city. The patriarchinterceded earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as noteven ten righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake thecity would have been spared, the threatened destruction fellupon it; and early next morning Abraham saw the smoke of thefire that consumed it as the \"smoke of a furnace\" (Gen.19:1-28).<br><br>After fifteen years\' residence at Mamre, Abraham movedsouthward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines, near toGerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication on hispart in his relation to Abimelech the King (Gen. 20). (See[5]ABIMELECH.) Soon after this event, the patriarch left thevicinity of Gerar, and moved down the fertile valley about 25miles to Beer-sheba. It was probably here that Isaac was born,Abraham being now an hundred years old. A feeling of jealousynow arose between Sarah and Hagar, whose son, Ishmael, was nolonger to be regarded as Abraham\'s heir. Sarah insisted thatboth Hagar and her son should be sent away. This was done,although it was a hard trial to Abraham (Gen. 21:12). (See[6]HAGAR; [7]ISHMAEL.)<br><br>At this point there is a blank in the patriarch\'s history ofperhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace and happinesswere spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we see him his faith isput to a severe test by the command that suddenly came to him togo and offer up Isaac, the heir of all the promises, as asacrifice on one of the mountains of Moriah. His faith stood thetest (Heb. 11:17-19). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitatingobedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay hisson, whom he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand wasarrested by the angel of Jehovah, and a ram, which was entangledin a thicket near at hand, was seized and offered in his stead.From this circumstance that place was called Jehovah-jireh,i.e., \"The Lord will provide.\" The promises made to Abraham wereagain confirmed (and this was the last recorded word of God tothe patriarch); and he descended the mount with his son, andreturned to his home at Beer-sheba (Gen. 22:19), where heresided for some years, and then moved northward to Hebron.<br><br>Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years old.Abraham acquired now the needful possession of a burying-place,the cave of Machpelah, by purchase from the owner of it, Ephronthe Hittite (Gen. 23); and there he buried Sarah. His next carewas to provide a wife for Isaac, and for this purpose he senthis steward, Eliezer, to Haran (or Charran, Acts 7:2), where hisbrother Nahor and his family resided (Gen. 11:31). The resultwas that Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor\'s son Bethuel, becamethe wife of Isaac (Gen. 24). Abraham then himself took to wifeKeturah, who became the mother of six sons, whose descendantswere afterwards known as the \"children of the east\" (Judg. 6:3),and later as \"Saracens.\" At length all his wanderings came to anend. At the age of 175 years, 100 years after he had firstentered the land of Canaan, he died, and was buried in the oldfamily burying-place at Machpelah (Gen. 25:7-10).<br><br>The history of Abraham made a wide and deep impression on theancient world, and references to it are interwoven in thereligious traditions of almost all Eastern nations. He is called\"the friend of God\" (James 2:23), \"faithful Abraham\" (Gal. 3:9),\"the father of us all\" (Rom. 4:16).<br><br>'),
(55, 'Abraham\'s bosom', '(Luke 16:22, 23) refers to the custom of reclining on couches attable, which was prevalent among the Jews, an arrangement whichbrought the head of one person almost into the bosom of the onewho sat or reclined above him. To \"be in Abraham\'s bosom\" thusmeant to enjoy happiness and rest (Matt. 8:11; Luke 16:23) atthe banquet in Paradise. (See [8]banquet; [9]MEALS.)<br><br>'),

(58, 'Absalom', 'Father of peace; i.e., \"peaceful\" David\'s son by Maacah (2 Sam.3:3; comp. 1 Kings 1:6). He was noted for his personal beautyand for the extra-ordinary profusion of the hair of his head (2Sam. 14:25,26). The first public act of his life was theblood-revenge he executed against Amnon, David\'s eldest son, whohad basely wronged Absalom\'s sister Tamar. This revenge wasexecuted at the time of the festivities connected with a greatsheep-shearing at Baal-hazor. David\'s other sons fled from theplace in horror, and brought the tidings of the death of Amnonto Jerusalem. Alarmed for the consequences of the act, Absalomfled to his grandfather at Geshur, and there abode for threeyears (2 Sam. 3:3; 13:23-38).<br><br>David mourned his absent son, now branded with the guilt offratricide. As the result of a stratagem carried out by a womanof Tekoah, Joab received David\'s sanction to invite Absalom backto Jerusalem. He returned accordingly, but two years elapsedbefore his father admitted him into his presence (2 Sam. 14:28).Absalom was now probably the oldest surviving son of David, andas he was of royal descent by his mother as well as by hisfather, he began to aspire to the throne. His pretensions werefavoured by the people. By many arts he gained their affection;and after his return from Geshur (2 Sam. 15:7; marg., R.V.) hewent up to Hebron, the old capital of Judah, along with a greatbody of the people, and there proclaimed himself king. Therevolt was so successful that David found it necessary to quitJerusalem and flee to Mahanaim, beyond Jordan; where uponAbsalom returned to Jerusalem and took possession of the thronewithout opposition. Ahithophel, who had been David\'s chiefcounsellor, deserted him and joined Absalom, whose chiefcounsellor he now became. Hushai also joined Absalom, but onlyfor the purpose of trying to counteract the counsels ofAhithophel, and so to advantage David\'s cause. He was so farsuccessful that by his advice, which was preferred to that ofAhithophel, Absalom delayed to march an army against his father,who thus gained time to prepare for the defence.<br><br>Absalom at length marched out against his father, whose army,under the command of Joab, he encountered on the borders of theforest of Ephraim. Twenty thousand of Absalom\'s army were slainin that fatal battle, and the rest fled. Absalom fled on a swiftmule; but his long flowing hair, or more probably his head, wascaught in the bough of an oak, and there he was left suspendedtill Joab came up and pierced him through with three darts. Hisbody was then taken down and cast into a pit dug in the forest,and a heap of stones was raised over his grave. When the tidingsof the result of that battle were brought to David, as he satimpatiently at the gate of Mahanaim, and he was told thatAbsalom had been slain, he gave way to the bitter lamentation:\"O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had diedfor thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\" (2 Sam. 18:33. Comp. Ex.32:32; Rom. 9:3).<br><br>Absalom\'s three sons (2 Sam. 14:27; comp. 18:18) had all diedbefore him, so that he left only a daughter, Tamar, who becamethe grandmother of Abijah.<br><br>'),

Theyinvented the form of writing in pictorial hieroglyphics, andalso the cuneiform system, in which they wrote many books partlyon papyrus and partly on clay. The Semitic Babylonians (\"thewhite race\"), or, as some scholars think, first the Cushites,and afterwards, as a second immigration, the Semites, invadedand conquered this country; and then the Accadian languageceased to be a spoken language, although for the sake of itsliterary treasures it continued to be studied by the educatedclasses of Babylonia. A large portion of the Ninevite tabletsbrought to light by Oriental research consists of interlinear orparallel translations from Accadian into Assyrian; and thus thatlong-forgotten language has been recovered by scholars. Itbelongs to the class of languages called agglutinative, commonto the Tauranian race; i.e., it consists of words \"gluedtogether,\" without declension of conjugation. These tablets in aremarkable manner illustrate ancient history.

Comp.Job 1:6; Zech. 3:1), as seeking to uphold his influence amongmen by bringing false charges against Christians, with the viewof weakening their influence and injuring the cause with whichthey are identified. He was regarded by the Jews as the accuserof men before God, laying to their charge the violations of thelaw of which they were guilty, and demanding their punishment.The same Greek word, rendered \"accuser,\" is found in John 8:10(but omitted in the Revised Version); Acts 23:30, 35; 24:8;25:16, 18, in all of which places it is used of one who brings acharge against another.<br><br>'),
(63, 'Aceldama', 'The name which the Jews gave in their proper tongue, i.e., inAramaic, to the field which was purchased with the money whichhad been given to the betrayer of our Lord.

Subsequently it was appliedby the Romans to the whole Peloponnesus, now called the Morea,and the south of Greece. It was then one of the two provinces(Macedonia being the other) into which they divided the countrywhen it fell under their dominion. It is in this latter enlargedmeaning that the name is always used in the New Testament (Acts18:12, 27; 19:21; Rom. 15: 26; 16:5, etc.). It was at the timewhen Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles under the proconsularform of government; hence the appropriate title given to Gallioas the \"deputy,\" i.e., proconsul, of Achaia (Acts 18:12).<br><br>'),

On the occasion of the fall of Jericho,he seized, contrary to the divine command, an ingot of gold, aquantity of silver, and a costly Babylonish garment, which hehid in his tent. Joshua was convinced that the defeat which theIsraelites afterwards sustained before Ai was a proof of thedivine displeasure on account of some crime, and he at onceadopted means by the use of the lot for discovering thecriminal. It was then found that Achan was guilty, and he wasstoned to death in the valley of Achor.

He is called Abimelechin the superscription of Ps. 34. It was probably this same kingto whom David a second time repaired at the head of a band of600 warriors, and who assigned him Ziklag, whence he carried onwar against the surrounding tribes (1 Sam. 27:5-12). Achish hadgreat confidence in the valour and fidelity of David (1 Sam.28:1, 2), but at the instigation of his courtiers did not permithim to go up to battle along with the Philistine hosts (1 Sam.29:2-11). David remained with Achish a year and four months.(2.) Another king of Gath, probably grandson of the foregoing,to whom the two servants of Shimei fled.

(70, 'Achor', 'Trouble, a valley near Jericho, so called in consequence of thetrouble which the sin of Achan caused Israel (Josh. 7:24, 26).The expression \"valley of Achor\" probably became proverbial forthat which caused trouble, and when Isaiah (Isa. 65:10) refersto it he uses it in this sense: \"The valley of Achor, a placefor herds to lie down in;\" i.e., that which had been a source ofcalamity would become a source of blessing. Hosea also (Hos.2:15) uses the expression in the same sense: \"The valley ofAchor for a door of hope;\" i.e., trouble would be turned intojoy, despair into hope. This valley has been identified with theWady Kelt.<br><br>'),

(75, 'Acts of the Apostles', 'The title now given to the fifth and last of the historicalbooks of the New Testament. The author styles it a \"treatise\"(1:1). It was early called \"The Acts,\" \"The Gospel of the HolyGhost,\" and \"The Gospel of the Resurrection.\" It containsproperly no account of any of the apostles except Peter andPaul. John is noticed only three times; and all that is recordedof James, the son of Zebedee, is his execution by Herod. It isproperly therefore not the history of the \"Acts of theApostles,\" a title which was given to the book at a later date,but of \"Acts of Apostles,\" or more correctly, of \"Some Acts ofCertain Apostles.\"<br><br>As regards its authorship, it was certainly the work of Luke,the \"beloved physician\" (comp. Luke 1:1-4; Acts 1:1). This isthe uniform tradition of antiquity, although the writer nowheremakes mention of himself by name. The style and idiom of theGospel of Luke and of the Acts, and the usage of words andphrases common to both, strengthen this opinion. The writerfirst appears in the narrative in 16:11, and then disappearstill Paul\'s return to Philippi two years afterwards, when he andPaul left that place together (20:6), and the two seemhenceforth to have been constant companions to the end. He wascertainly with Paul at Rome (28; Col. 4:14). Thus he wrote agreat portion of that history from personal observation. Forwhat lay beyond his own experience he had the instruction ofPaul. If, as is very probable, 2 Tim. was written during Paul\'ssecond imprisonment at Rome, Luke was with him then as hisfaithful companion to the last (2 Tim. 4:11). Of his subsequenthistory we have no certain information.<br><br>The design of Luke\'s Gospel was to give an exhibition of thecharacter and work of Christ as seen in his history till he wastaken up from his disciples into heaven; and of the Acts, as itssequel, to give an illustration of the power and working of thegospel when preached among all nations, \"beginning atJerusalem.\" The opening sentences of the Acts are just anexpansion and an explanation of the closing words of the Gospel.In this book we have just a continuation of the history of thechurch after Christ\'s ascension. Luke here carries on thehistory in the same spirit in which he had commenced it. It isonly a book of beginnings, a history of the founding ofchurches, the initial steps in the formation of the Christiansociety in the different places visited by the apostles. Itrecords a cycle of \"representative events.\"<br><br>All through the narrative we see the ever-present,all-controlling power of the ever-living Saviour. He worketh alland in all in spreading abroad his truth among men by his Spiritand through the instrumentality of his apostles.<br><br>The time of the writing of this history may be gathered from thefact that the narrative extends down to the close of the secondyear of Paul\'s first imprisonment at Rome. It could nottherefore have been written earlier than A.D. 61 or 62, norlater than about the end of A.D. 63. Paul was probably put todeath during his second imprisonment, about A.D. 64, or, as somethink, 66.<br><br>The place where the book was written was probably Rome, to whichLuke accompanied Paul.<br><br>The key to the contents of the book is in 1:8, \"Ye shall bewitnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and inSamaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\" Afterreferring to what had been recorded in a \"former treatise\" ofthe sayings and doings of Jesus Christ before his ascension, theauthor proceeds to give an account of the circumstancesconnected with that event, and then records the leading factswith reference to the spread and triumphs of Christianity overthe world during a period of about thirty years. The recordbegins with Pentecost (A.D. 33) and ends with Paul\'s firstimprisonment (A.D. 63 or 64). The whole contents of the book maybe divided into these three parts:<br><br>(1.) Chaps. 1-12, describing the first twelve years of theChristian church. This section has been entitled \"From Jerusalemto Antioch.\" It contains the history of the planting andextension of the church among the Jews by the ministry of Peter.<br><br>(2.) Chaps. 13-21, Paul\'s missionary journeys, giving thehistory of the extension and planting of the church among theGentiles.<br><br>(3.) Chaps. 21-28, Paul at Rome, and the events which led tothis. Chaps. 13-28 have been entitled \"From Antioch to Rome.\"<br><br>In this book it is worthy of note that no mention is made of thewriting by Paul of any of his epistles. This may be accountedfor by the fact that the writer confined himself to a history ofthe planting of the church, and not to that of its training oredification. The relation, however, between this history and theepistles of Paul is of such a kind, i.e., brings to light somany undesigned coincidences, as to prove the genuineness andauthenticity of both, as is so ably shown by Paley in his HoraePaulinae. \"No ancient work affords so many tests of veracity;for no other has such numerous points of contact in alldirections with contemporary history, politics, and topography,whether Jewish, or Greek, or Roman.\" Lightfoot.

It wasthe name given to the first man, whose creation, fall, andsubsequent history and that of his descendants are detailed inthe first book of Moses (Gen. 1:27-ch. 5). \"God created man[Heb., Adam] in his own image, in the image of God created hehim; male and female created he them.\"<br><br>Adam was absolutely the first man whom God created. He wasformed out of the dust of the earth (and hence his name), andGod breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and gave himdominion over all the lower creatures (Gen. 1:26; 2:7). He wasplaced after his creation in the Garden of Eden, to cultivateit, and to enjoy its fruits under this one prohibition: \"Of thetree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it;for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\"<br><br>The first recorded act of Adam was his giving names to thebeasts of the field and the fowls of the air, which God broughtto him for this end. Thereafter the Lord caused a deep sleep tofall upon him, and while in an unconscious state took one of hisribs, and closed up his flesh again; and of this rib he made awoman, whom he presented to him when he awoke. Adam received heras his wife, and said, \"This is now bone of my bones, and fleshof my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was takenout of Man.\" He called her Eve, because she was the mother ofall living.<br><br>Being induced by the tempter in the form of a serpent to eat theforbidden fruit, Eve persuaded Adam, and he also did eat. Thusman fell, and brought upon himself and his posterity all the sadconsequences of his transgression. The narrative of the Fallcomprehends in it the great promise of a Deliverer (Gen. 3:15),the \"first gospel\" message to man. They were expelled from Eden,and at the east of the garden God placed a flame, which turnedevery way, to prevent access to the tree of life (Gen. 3). Howlong they were in Paradise is matter of mere conjecture.<br><br>Shortly after their expulsion Eve brought forth her first-born,and called him Cain. Although we have the names of only three ofAdam\'s sons, viz., Cain, Abel, and Seth, yet it is obvious thathe had several sons and daughters (Gen. 5:4). He died aged 930years.<br><br>Adam and Eve were the progenitors of the whole human race.Evidences of varied kinds are abundant in proving the unity ofthe human race. The investigations of science, altogetherindependent of historical evidence, lead to the conclusion thatGod \"hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell onall the face of the earth\" (Acts 17:26.

Tisri, former half.,Ingathering of fruits.<br><br>The six months from the middle of Tisri to the middle of Nisanwere occupied with the work of cultivation, and the rest of theyear mainly with the gathering in of the fruits. The extensiveand easily-arranged system of irrigation from the rills andstreams from the mountains made the soil in every part ofPalestine richly productive (Ps. 1:3; 65:10; Prov. 21:1; Isa.30:25; 32:2, 20; Hos. 12:11), and the appliances of carefulcultivation and of manure increased its fertility to such anextent that in the days of Solomon, when there was an abundantpopulation, \"20,000 measures of wheat year by year\" were sent toHiram in exchange for timber (1 Kings 5:11), and in largequantities also wheat was sent to the Tyrians for themerchandise in which they traded (Ezek. 27:17). The wheatsometimes produced an hundredfold (Gen. 26:12; Matt. 13:23).Figs and pomegranates were very plentiful (Num. 13:23), and thevine and the olive grew luxuriantly and produced abundant fruit(Deut. 33:24).<br><br>Lest the productiveness of the soil should be exhausted, it wasenjoined that the whole land should rest every seventh year,when all agricultural labour would entirely cease (Lev. 25:1-7;Deut. 15:1-10).<br><br>It was forbidden to sow a field with divers seeds (Deut. 22:9).A passer-by was at liberty to eat any quantity of corn orgrapes, but he was not permitted to carry away any (Deut. 23:24,25; Matt. 12:1).

They were drawn by oxen (Job 1:14), cows (1 Sam.6:7), and asses (Isa. 30:24); but an ox and an ass must not beyoked together in the same plough (Deut. 22:10). Men sometimesfollowed the plough with a hoe to break the clods (Isa. 28:24).The oxen were urged on by a \"goad,\" or long staff pointed at theend, so that if occasion arose it could be used as a spear also(Judg. 3:31; 1 Sam. 13:21).<br><br>When the soil was prepared, the seed was sown broadcast over thefield (Matt. 13:3-8). The \"harrow\" mentioned in Job 39:10 wasnot used to cover the seeds, but to break the clods, beinglittle more than a thick block of wood. In highly irrigatedspots the seed was trampled in by cattle (Isa. 32:20); butdoubtless there was some kind of harrow also for covering in theseed scattered in the furrows of the field.<br><br>The reaping of the corn was performed either by pulling it up bythe roots, or cutting it with a species of sickle, according tocircumstances. The corn when cut was generally put up in sheaves(Gen. 37:7; Lev. 23:10-15; Ruth 2:7, 15; Job 24:10; Jer. 9:22;Micah 4:12), which were afterwards gathered to thethreshing-floor or stored in barns (Matt. 6:26).<br><br>The process of threshing was performed generally by spreadingthe sheaves on the threshing-floor and causing oxen and cattleto tread repeatedly over them (Deut. 25:4; Isa. 28:28). Onoccasions flails or sticks were used for this purpose (Ruth2:17; Isa. 28:27). There was also a \"threshing instrument\" (Isa.41:15; Amos 1:3) which was drawn over the corn. It was called bythe Hebrews a moreg, a threshing roller or sledge (2 Sam. 24:22;1 Chr. 21:23; Isa. 3:15). It was somewhat like the Romantribulum, or threshing instrument.<br><br>When the grain was threshed, it was winnowed by being thrown upagainst the wind (Jer. 4:11), and afterwards tossed with woodenscoops (Isa. 30:24). The shovel and the fan for winnowing arementioned in Ps. 35:5, Job 21:18, Isa. 17:13. The refuse ofstraw and chaff was burned (Isa. 5:24).

Jacob desired his sons (Gen. 43:11) totake with them into Egypt of the best fruits of the land,almonds, etc., as a present to Joseph, probably because thistree was not a native of Egypt. Aaron\'s rod yielded almonds(Num. 17:8; Heb. 9:4). Moses was directed to make certain partsof the candlestick for the ark of carved work \"like untoalmonds\" (Ex. 25:33, 34).

It ismentioned as a surprising circumstance that in the days ofSamuel there was peace between them and the Israelites (1 Sam.7:14).

By common agreement the members of the early Christiancommunity devoted their property to the work of furthering thegospel and of assisting the poor and needy. The proceeds of thepossessions they sold were placed at the disposal of theapostles (Acts 4:36, 37). Ananias might have kept his propertyhad he so chosen; but he professed agreement with the brethrenin the common purpose, and had of his own accord devoted it all,as he said, to these sacred ends. Yet he retained a part of itfor his own ends, and thus lied in declaring that he had givenit all. \"The offence of Ananias and Sapphira showed contempt ofGod, vanity and ambition in the offenders, and utter disregardof the corruption which they were bringing into the society.Such sin, committed in despite of the light which theypossessed, called for a special mark of divine indignation.\"<br><br>(2.)

The expression may mean (a) that Paul had at themoment overlooked the honour due to the high priest; or (b), asothers think, that Paul spoke ironically, as if he had said,\"The high priest breaking the law! God\'s high priest a tyrantand a lawbreaker! I see a man in white robes, and have heard hisvoice, but surely it cannot, it ought not to be, the voice ofthe high priest.\" (See Dr. Lindsay on Acts, in loco.)

In this sense the form of theword is anath(ee)ma, once in plural used in the Greek NewTestament, in Luke 21:5, where it is rendered \"gifts.\" In theLXX. the form anathema is generally used as the rendering of theHebrew word herem, derived from a verb which means (1) toconsecrate or devote; and (2) to exterminate. Any object sodevoted to the Lord could not be redeemed (Num. 18:14; Lev.27:28, 29); and hence the idea of exterminating connected withthe word. The Hebrew verb (haram) is frequently used of theextermination of idolatrous nations. It had a wide range ofapplication. The anathema_ or _herem was a person or thingirrevocably devoted to God (Lev. 27:21, 28); and \"none devotedshall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death\" (27:29). Theword therefore carried the idea of devoted to destruction (Num.21:2, 3; Josh. 6:17); and hence generally it meant a thingaccursed. In Deut. 7:26 an idol is called a herem = anathema, athing accursed.<br><br>In the New Testament this word always implies execration. Insome cases an individual denounces an anathema on himself unlesscertain conditions are fulfilled (Acts 23:12, 14, 21). \"To callJesus accursed\" [anathema] (1 Cor. 12:3) is to pronounce himexecrated or accursed. If any one preached another gospel, theapostle says, \"let him be accursed\" (Gal. 1:8, 9); i.e., let hisconduct in so doing be accounted accursed.<br><br>In Rom. 9:3, the expression \"accursed\" (anathema) from Christ,i.e., excluded from fellowship or alliance with Christ, hasoccasioned much difficulty. The apostle here does not speak ofhis wish as a possible thing. It is simply a vehement expressionof feeling, showing how strong was his desire for the salvationof his people.<br><br>The anathema in 1 Cor. 16:22 denotes simply that they who lovenot the Lord are rightly objects of loathing and execration toall holy beings; they are guilty of a crime that merits theseverest condemnation; they are exposed to the just sentence of\"everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.\"<br><br>'),
(233, 'Anathoth', 'The name of one of the cities of refuge, in the tribe ofBenjamin (Josh. 21:18). The Jews, as a rule, did not change thenames of the towns they found in Palestine; hence this town maybe regarded as deriving its name from the goddess Anat. It wasthe native place of Abiezer, one of David\'s \"thirty\" (2 Sam.23:27), and of Jehu, another of his mighty men (1 Chr. 12:3). Itis chiefly notable, however, as the birth-place and usualresidence of Jeremiah (Jer. 1:1; 11:21-23; 29:27; 32:7-9). Itsuffered greatly from the army of Sennacherib, and only 128 menreturned to it from the Exile (Neh. 7:27; Ezra 2:23). It layabout 3 miles north of Jerusalem.

(234, 'Anchor', 'From Acts 27:29, 30, 40, it would appear that the Roman vesselscarried several anchors, which were attached to the stern aswell as to the prow. The Roman anchor, like the modern one, hadtwo teeth or flukes. In Heb. 6:19 the word is usedmetaphorically for that which supports or keeps one steadfast inthe time of trial or of doubt.

(236, 'Andrew', 'Manliness, a Greek name; one of the apostles of our Lord. He wasof Bethsaida in Galilee (John 1:44), and was the brother ofSimon Peter (Matt. 4:18; 10:2). On one occasion John theBaptist, whose disciple he then was, pointing to Jesus, said,\"Behold the Lamb of God\" (John 1:40); and Andrew, hearing him,immediately became a follower of Jesus, the first of hisdisciples. After he had been led to recognize Jesus as theMessiah, his first care was to bring also his brother Simon toJesus. The two brothers seem to have after this pursued for awhile their usual calling as fishermen, and did not become thestated attendants of the Lord till after John\'s imprisonment(Matt. 4:18, 19; Mark 1:16, 17). Very little is related ofAndrew. He was one of the confidential disciples (John 6:8;12:22), and with Peter, James, and John inquired of our Lordprivately regarding his future coming (Mark 13:3). He waspresent at the feeding of the five thousand (John 6:9), and heintroduced the Greeks who desired to see Jesus (John 12:22); butof his subsequent history little is known. It is noteworthy thatAndrew thrice brings others to Christ, (1) Peter; (2) the ladwith the loaves; and (3) certain Greeks. These incidents may beregarded as a key to his character.<br><br>'),

(240, 'Angel', 'A word signifying, both in the Hebrew and Greek, a \"messenger,\"and hence employed to denote any agent God sends forth toexecute his purposes. It is used of an ordinary messenger (Job1:14: 1 Sam. 11:3; Luke 7:24; 9:52), of prophets (Isa. 42:19;Hag. 1:13), of priests (Mal. 2:7), and ministers of the NewTestament (Rev. 1:20).<br><br>It is also applied to such impersonal agents as the pestilence(2 Sam. 24:16, 17; 2 Kings 19:35), the wind (Ps. 104:4).<br><br>But its distinctive application is to certain heavenlyintelligences whom God employs in carrying on his government ofthe world. The name does not denote their nature but theiroffice as messengers. The appearances to Abraham at Mamre (Gen.18:2, 22. Comp. 19:1), to Jacob at Peniel (Gen. 32:24, 30), toJoshua at Gilgal (Josh. 5:13, 15), of the Angel of the Lord,were doubtless manifestations of the Divine presence,\"foreshadowings of the incarnation,\" revelations before the\"fulness of the time\" of the Son of God.<br><br>(1.) The existence and orders of angelic beings can only bediscovered from the Scriptures. Although the Bible does nottreat of this subject specially, yet there are numerousincidental details that furnish us with ample information. Theirpersonal existence is plainly implied in such passages as Gen.16:7, 10, 11; Judg. 13:1-21; Matt. 28:2-5; Heb. 1:4, etc.<br><br>These superior beings are very numerous. \"Thousand thousands,\"etc. (Dan. 7:10; Matt. 26:53; Luke 2:13; Heb. 12:22, 23). Theyare also spoken of as of different ranks in dignity and power(Zech. 1:9, 11; Dan. 10:13; 12:1; 1 Thess. 4:16; Jude 1:9; Eph.1:21; Col. 1:16).<br><br>(2.) As to their nature, they are spirits (Heb. 1:14), like thesoul of man, but not incorporeal. Such expressions as \"like theangels\" (Luke 20:36), and the fact that whenever angels appearedto man it was always in a human form (Gen. 18:2; 19:1, 10; Luke24:4; Acts 1:10), and the titles that are applied to them (\"sonsof God,\" Job 1:6; 38:7; Dan. 3:25; comp. 28) and to men (Luke3:38), seem all to indicate some resemblance between them andthe human race. Imperfection is ascribed to them as creatures(Job 4:18; Matt. 24:36; 1 Pet. 1:12). As finite creatures theymay fall under temptation; and accordingly we read of \"fallenangels.\" Of the cause and manner of their \"fall\" we are whollyignorant. We know only that \"they left their first estate\"(Matt. 25:41; Rev. 12:7, 9), and that they are \"reserved untojudgement\" (2 Pet. 2:4). When the manna is called \"angels\'food,\" this is merely to denote its excellence (Ps. 78:25).Angels never die (Luke 20:36). They are possessed of superhumanintelligence and power (Mark 13:32; 2 Thess. 1:7; Ps. 103:20).They are called \"holy\" (Luke 9:26), \"elect\" (1 Tim. 5:21). Theredeemed in glory are \"like unto the angels\" (Luke 20:36). Theyare not to be worshipped (Col. 2:18; Rev. 19:10).<br><br>(3.) Their functions are manifold. (a) In the widest sense theyare agents of God\'s providence (Ex. 12:23; Ps. 104:4; Heb.11:28; 1 Cor. 10:10; 2 Sam. 24:16; 1 Chr. 21:16; 2 Kings 19:35;Acts 12:23). (b) They are specially God\'s agents in carrying onhis great work of redemption. There is no notice of angelicappearances to man till after the call of Abraham. From thattime onward there are frequent references to their ministry onearth (Gen. 18; 19; 24:7, 40; 28:12; 32:1). They appear torebuke idolatry (Judg. 2:1-4), to call Gideon (Judg. 6:11, 12),and to consecrate Samson (13:3). In the days of the prophets,from Samuel downward, the angels appear only in their behalf (1Kings 19:5; 2 Kings 6:17; Zech. 1-6; Dan. 4:13, 23; 10:10, 13,20, 21).<br><br>The Incarnation introduces a new era in the ministrations ofangels. They come with their Lord to earth to do him servicewhile here. They predict his advent (Matt. 1:20; Luke 1:26-38),minister to him after his temptation and agony (Matt. 4:11; Luke22:43), and declare his resurrection and ascension (Matt.28:2-8; John 20:12, 13; Acts 1:10, 11). They are now ministeringspirits to the people of God (Heb. 1:14; Ps. 34:7; 91:11; Matt.18:10; Acts 5:19; 8:26; 10:3; 12:7; 27:23). They rejoice over apenitent sinner (Luke 15:10). They bear the souls of theredeemed to paradise (Luke 16:22); and they will be theministers of judgement hereafter on the great day (Matt. 13:39,41, 49; 16:27; 24:31). The passages (Ps. 34:7, Matt. 18:10)usually referred to in support of the idea that every individualhas a particular guardian angel have no such meaning. Theymerely indicate that God employs the ministry of angels todeliver his people from affliction and danger, and that theangels do not think it below their dignity to minister even tochildren and to the least among Christ\'s disciples.<br><br>The \"angel of his presence\" (Isa. 63:9. Comp. Ex. 23:20, 21;32:34; 33:2; Num. 20:16) is probably rightly interpreted of theMessiah as the guide of his people. Others have supposed theexpression to refer to Gabriel (Luke 1:19).<br><br>'),
(241, 'Anger', 'The emotion of instant displeasure on account of something evilthat presents itself to our view. In itself it is an originalsusceptibility of our nature, just as love is, and is notnecessarily sinful. It may, however, become sinful whencauseless, or excessive, or protracted (Matt. 5:22; Eph. 4:26;Col. 3:8). As ascribed to God, it merely denotes his displeasurewith sin and with sinners (Ps. 7:11).<br><br>'),

This name dill is derived from a Norse word whichmeans to soothe, the plant having the carminative property ofallaying pain. The common dill, the Anethum graveolens, is anannual growing wild in the cornfields of Spain and Portugal andthe south of Europe generally. There is also a species of dillcultivated in Eastern countries known by the name of shubit. Itwas this species of garden plant of which the Pharisees were inthe habit of paying tithes. The Talmud requires that the seeds,leaves, and stem of dill shall pay tithes. It is anumbelliferous plant, very like the caraway, its leaves, whichare aromatic, being used in soups and pickles.

(246, 'Annas', 'Was high priest A.D. 7-14. In A.D. 25 Caiaphas, who had marriedthe daughter of Annas (John 18:13), was raised to that office,and probably Annas was now made president of the Sanhedrim, ordeputy or coadjutor of the high priest, and thus was also calledhigh priest along with Caiaphas (Luke 3:2). By the Mosaic lawthe high-priesthood was held for life (Num. 3:10); and althoughAnnas had been deposed by the Roman procurator, the Jews maystill have regarded him as legally the high priest. Our Lord wasfirst brought before Annas, and after a brief questioning of him(John 18:19-23) was sent to Caiaphas, when some members of theSanhedrim had met, and the first trial of Jesus took place(Matt. 26:57-68).

(247, 'Anoint', 'The practice of anointing with perfumed oil was common among theHebrews. (1.) The act of anointing was significant ofconsecration to a holy or sacred use; hence the anointing of thehigh priest (Ex. 29:29; Lev. 4:3) and of the sacred vessels (Ex.30:26). The high priest and the king are thus called \"theanointed\" (Lev. 4:3, 5, 16; 6:20; Ps. 132:10). Anointing a kingwas equivalent to crowning him (1 Sam. 16:13; 2 Sam. 2:4, etc.).Prophets were also anointed (1 Kings 19:16; 1 Chr. 16:22; Ps.105:15). The expression, \"anoint the shield\" (Isa. 21:5), refersto the custom of rubbing oil on the leather of the shield so asto make it supple and fit for use in war.<br><br>(2.) Anointing was also an act of hospitality (Luke 7:38, 46).It was the custom of the Jews in like manner to anointthemselves with oil, as a means of refreshing or invigoratingtheir bodies (Deut. 28:40; Ruth 3:3; 2 Sam. 14:2; Ps. 104:15,etc.). This custom is continued among the Arabians to thepresent day.<br><br>(3.) Oil was used also for medicinal purposes. It was applied tothe sick, and also to wounds (Ps. 109:18; Isa. 1:6; Mark 6:13;James 5:14).<br><br>(4.) The bodies of the dead were sometimes anointed (Mark 14:8;Luke 23:56).<br><br>(5.) The promised Deliverer is twice called the \"Anointed\" orMessiah (Ps. 2:2; Dan. 9:25, 26), because he was anointed withthe Holy Ghost (Isa. 61:1), figuratively styled the \"oil ofgladness\" (Ps. 45:7; Heb. 1:9).

It was called the \"first city of the East.\" Christianitywas early introduced into it (Acts 11:19, 21, 24), and the name\"Christian\" was first applied here to its professors (Acts11:26).

After his ascensionhe communicated to them, according to his promise, supernaturalgifts to qualify them for the discharge of their duties (Acts2:4; 1 Cor. 2:16; 2:7, 10, 13; 2 Cor. 5:20; 1 Cor. 11:2). JudasIscariot, one of \"the twelve,\" fell by transgression, andMatthias was substituted in his place (Acts 1:21). Saul ofTarsus was afterwards added to their number (Acts 9:3-20; 20:4;26:15-18; 1 Tim. 1:12; 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11).<br><br>Luke has given some account of Peter, John, and the two Jameses(Acts 12:2, 17; 15:13; 21:18), but beyond this we know nothingfrom authentic history of the rest of the original twelve. Afterthe martyrdom of James the Greater (Acts 12:2), James the Lessusually resided at Jerusalem, while Paul, \"the apostle of theuncircumcision,\" usually travelled as a missionary among theGentiles (Gal. 2:8).

Another qualification was the power of working miracles(Mark 16:20; Acts 2:43; 1 Cor. 12:8-11). The apostles thereforecould have had no successors.

One who had only this tunicon was spoken of as \"naked\" (1 Sam. 19:24; Job 24:10; Isa.20:2). Those in high stations sometimes wore two tunics, theouter being called the \"upper garment\" (1 Sam. 15:27; 18:4;24:5; Job 1:20). (2.) They wore in common an over-garment(\"mantle,\" Isa. 3:22; 1 Kings 19:13; 2 Kings 2:13), a loose andflowing robe. The folds of this upper garment could be formedinto a lap (Ruth 3:15; Ps. 79:12; Prov. 17:23; Luke 6:38).Generals of armies usually wore scarlet robes (Judg. 8:26; Nah.2:3). A form of conspicuous raiment is mentioned in Luke 20:46;comp. Matt. 23:5.<br><br>Priests alone wore trousers.

Thereis nothing to show that it was the \"tree of the knowledge ofgood and evil.\" Dr. Tristram has suggested that the apricot hasbetter claims than any other fruit-tree to be the apple ofScripture. It grows to a height of 30 feet, has a roundish massof glossy leaves, and bears an orange coloured fruit that givesout a delicious perfume.

It was 100 years inbuilding (Gen. 5:32; 7:6). It was intended to preserve certainpersons and animals from the deluge which God was about to bringover the earth. It contained eight persons (Gen. 7:13; 2 Pet.2:5), and of all \"clean\" animals seven pairs, and of \"unclean\"one pair, and of birds seven pairs of each sort (Gen. 7:2, 3).It was in the form of an oblong square, with flat bottom andsloping roof.

Over the ark, at the two extremities, were twocherubim, with their faces turned toward each other (Lev. 16:2;Num. 7:89). Their outspread wings over the top of the ark formedthe throne of God, while the ark itself was his footstool (Ex.25:10-22; 37:1-9). The ark was deposited in the \"holy ofholies,\" and was so placed that one end of the poles by which itwas carried touched the veil which separated the two apartmentsof the tabernacle (1 Kings 8:8).

(See [29]TABERNACLE) The ark and the sanctuary were\"the beauty of Israel\" (Lam. 2:1). During the journeys of theIsraelites the ark was carried by the priests in advance of thehost (Num. 4:5, 6; 10:33-36; Ps. 68:1; 132:8). It was borne bythe priests into the bed of the Jordan, which separated, openinga pathway for the whole of the host to pass over (Josh. 3:15,16; 4:7, 10, 11, 17, 18). It was borne in the procession roundJericho (Josh. 6:4, 6, 8, 11, 12).

After the settlement of Israel in Palestine the arkremained in the tabernacle at Gilgal for a season, and was thenremoved to Shiloh till the time of Eli, between 300 and 400years (Jer. 7:12), when it was carried into the field of battleso as to secure, as they supposed, victory to the Hebrews, andwas taken by the Philistines (1 Sam. 4:3-11), who sent it backafter retaining it seven months (1 Sam. 5:7, 8). It remainedthen at Kirjath-jearim (7:1, 2) till the time of David (twentyyears), who wished to remove it to Jerusalem; but the propermode of removing it having been neglected, Uzzah was smittenwith death for putting \"forth his hand to the ark of God,\" andin consequence of this it was left in the house of Obed-edom inGath-rimmon for three months (2 Sam. 6:1-11), at the end ofwhich time David removed it in a grand procession to Jerusalem,where it was kept till a place was prepared for it (12-19). Itwas afterwards deposited by Solomon in the temple (1 Kings8:6-9). When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plunderedthe temple, the ark was probably taken away by Nebuchadnezzarand destroyed, as no trace of it is afterwards to be found.

(315, 'Armour', 'Is employed in the English Bible to denote military equipment,both offensive and defensive.<br><br>(1.) The offensive weapons were different at different periodsof history. The \"rod of iron\" (Ps. 2:9) is supposed to mean amace or crowbar, an instrument of great power when used by astrong arm. The \"maul\" (Prov. 25:18; cognate Hebrew wordrendered \"battle-axe\" in Jer. 51:20, and \"slaughter weapon\" inEzek. 9:2) was a war-hammer or martel. The \"sword\" is the usualtranslation of hereb, which properly means \"poniard.\" The realsword, as well as the dirk-sword (which was alwaysdouble-edged), was also used (1 Sam. 17:39; 2 Sam. 20:8; 1 Kings20:11). The spear was another offensive weapon (Josh. 8:18; 1Sam. 17:7). The javelin was used by light troops (Num. 25:7, 8;1 Sam. 13:22). Saul threw a javelin at David (1 Sam. 19:9, 10),and so virtually absolved him from his allegiance. The bow was,however, the chief weapon of offence. The arrows were carried ina quiver, the bow being always unbent till the moment of action(Gen. 27:3; 48:22; Ps. 18:34). The sling was a favourite weaponof the Benjamites (1 Sam. 17:40; 1 Chr. 12:2. Comp. 1 Sam.25:29).<br><br>(2.) Of the defensive armour a chief place is assigned to theshield or buckler. There were the great shield or target (thetzinnah), for the protection of the whole person (Gen. 15:1; Ps.47:9; 1 Sam. 17:7; Prov. 30:5), and the buckler (Heb. mageen) orsmall shield (1 Kings 10:17; Ezek. 26:8).

Greaves, for thecovering of the legs, were worn in the time of David (1 Sam.17:6). Reference is made by Paul (Eph. 6:14-17) to the panoplyof a Roman soldier. The shield here is the thureon, a door-likeoblong shield above all, i.e., covering the whole person, notthe small round shield. There is no armour for the back, butonly for the front.<br><br>'),

From the time of their enteringthe land of Canaan to the time of the kings, the Israelites madelittle progress in military affairs, although often engaged inwarfare. The kings introduced the custom of maintaining abodyguard (the Gibborim; i.e., \"heroes\"), and thus the nucleusof a standing army was formed. Saul had an army of 3,000 selectwarriors (1 Sam. 13:2; 14:52; 24:2). David also had a band ofsoldiers around him (1 Sam. 23:13; 25:13). To this band heafterwards added the Cherethites and the Pelethites (2 Sam.15:18; 20:7). At first the army consisted only of infantry (1Sam. 4:10; 15:4), as the use of horses was prohibited (Deut.17:16); but chariots and horses were afterwards added (2 Sam.8:4; 1 Kings 10:26, 28, 29; 1 Kings 9:19).

The \"fullassurance [Gr. plerophoria, full bearing\'] of faith\" (Heb.10:22) is a fulness of faith in God which leaves no room fordoubt. The \"full assurance of understanding\" (Col. 2:2) is anentire unwavering conviction of the truth of the declarations ofScripture, a joyful steadfastness on the part of any one ofconviction that he has grasped the very truth. The \"fullassurance of hope\" (Heb. 6:11) is a sure and well-groundedexpectation of eternal glory (2 Tim. 4:7, 8). This assurance ofhope is the assurance of a man\'s own particular salvation.<br><br>This infallible assurance, which believers may attain unto as totheir own personal salvation, is founded on the truth of thepromises (Heb. 6:18), on the inward evidence of Christiangraces, and on the testimony of the Spirit of adoption (Rom.8:16). That such a certainty may be attained appears from thetestimony of Scripture (Rom. 8:16; 1 John 2:3; 3:14), from thecommand to seek after it (Heb. 6:11; 2 Pet. 1:10), and from thefact that it has been attained (2 Tim. 1:12; 4:7, 8; 1 John 2:3;4:16).<br><br>This full assurance is not of the essence of saving faith. It isthe result of faith, and posterior to it in the order of nature,and so frequently also in the order of time. True believers maybe destitute of it. Trust itself is something different from theevidence that we do trust. Believers, moreover, are exhorted togo on to something beyond what they at present have when theyare exhorted to seek the grace of full assurance (Heb. 10:22; 2Pet. 1:5-10). The attainment of this grace is a duty, and is tobe diligently sought.<br><br>\"Genuine assurance naturally leads to a legitimate and abidingpeace and joy, and to love and thankfulness to God; and thesefrom the very laws of our being to greater buoyancy, strength,and cheerfulness in the practice of obedience in everydepartment of duty.\"<br><br>This assurance may in various ways be shaken, diminished, andintermitted, but the principle out of which it springs can neverbe lost.

(353, 'Assyria', 'The name derived from the city Asshur on the Tigris, theoriginal capital of the country, was originally a colony fromBabylonia, and was ruled by viceroys from that kingdom. It was amountainous region lying to the north of Babylonia, extendingalong the Tigris as far as to the high mountain range ofArmenia, the Gordiaean or Carduchian mountains. It was foundedin B.C. 1700 under Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and aconquering power, and shook off the yoke of its Babylonianmasters. It subdued the whole of Northern Asia. The Assyrianswere Semites (Gen. 10:22), but in process of time non-Semitetribes mingled with the inhabitants. They were a militarypeople, the \"Romans of the East.\"<br><br>Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria little ispositively known. In B.C. 1120 Tiglath-pileser I., the greatestof the Assyrian kings, \"crossed the Euphrates, defeated thekings of the Hittites, captured the city of Carchemish, andadvanced as far as the shores of the Mediterranean.\" He may beregarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. After thisthe Assyrians gradually extended their power, subjugating thestates of Northern Syria. In the reign of Ahab, king of Israel,Shalmaneser II. marched an army against the Syrian states, whoseallied army he encountered and vanquished at Karkar. This led toAhab\'s casting off the yoke of Damascus and allying himself withJudah. Some years after this the Assyrian king marched an armyagainst Hazael, king of Damascus. He besieged and took thatcity. He also brought under tribute Jehu, and the cities of Tyreand Sidon.<br><br>About a hundred years after this (B.C. 745) the crown was seizedby a military adventurer called Pul, who assumed the name ofTiglath-pileser III. He directed his armies into Syria, whichhad by this time regained its independence, and took (B.C. 740)Arpad, near Aleppo, after a siege of three years, and reducedHamath. Azariah (Uzziah) was an ally of the king of Hamath, andthus was compelled by Tiglath-pileser to do him homage and pay ayearly tribute.<br><br>In B.C. 738, in the reign of Menahem, king of Israel, Pulinvaded Israel, and imposed on it a heavy tribute (2 Kings15:19). Ahaz, the king of Judah, when engaged in a war againstIsrael and Syria, appealed for help to this Assyrian king bymeans of a present of gold and silver (2 Kings 16:8); whoaccordingly \"marched against Damascus, defeated and put Rezin todeath, and besieged the city itself.\" Leaving a portion of hisarmy to continue the siege, \"he advanced through the provinceeast of Jordan, spreading fire and sword,\" and became master ofPhilistia, and took Samaria and Damascus. He died B.C. 727, andwas succeeded by Shalmanezer IV., who ruled till B.C. 722. Healso invaded Syria (2 Kings 17:5), but was deposed in favour ofSargon (q.v.) the Tartan, or commander-in-chief of the army, whotook Samaria (q.v.) after a siege of three years, and so put anend to the kingdom of Israel, carrying the people away intocaptivity, B.C. 722 (2 Kings 17:1-6, 24; 18:7, 9). He alsooverran the land of Judah, and took the city of Jerusalem (Isa.10:6, 12, 22, 24, 34). Mention is next made of Sennacherib (B.C.705), the son and successor of Sargon (2 Kings 18:13; 19:37;Isa. 7:17, 18); and then of Esar-haddon, his son and successor,who took Manasseh, king of Judah, captive, and kept him for sometime a prisoner at Babylon, which he alone of all the Assyriankings made the seat of his government (2 Kings 19:37; Isa.37:38).<br><br>Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esarhaddon, became king, and in Ezra4:10 is referred to as Asnapper. From an early period Assyriahad entered on a conquering career, and having absorbed Babylon,the kingdoms of Hamath, Damascus, and Samaria, it conqueredPhoenicia, and made Judea feudatory, and subjected Philistia andIdumea. At length, however, its power declined. In B.C. 727 theBabylonians threw off the rule of the Assyrians, under theleadership of the powerful Chaldean prince Merodach-baladan (2Kings 20:12), who, after twelve years, was subdued by Sargon,who now reunited the kingdom, and ruled over a vast empire. Buton his death the smouldering flames of rebellion again burstforth, and the Babylonians and Medes successfully asserted theirindependence (B.C. 625), and Assyria fell according to theprophecies of Isaiah (10:5-19), Nahum (3:19), and Zephaniah(3:13), and the many separate kingdoms of which it was composedceased to recognize the \"great king\" (2 Kings 18:19; Isa. 36:4).Ezekiel (31) attests (about B.C. 586) how completely Assyria wasoverthrown.

(362, 'Atonement', 'This word does not occur in the Authorized Version of the NewTestament except in Rom. 5:11, where in the Revised Version theword \"reconciliation\" is used. In the Old Testament it is offrequent occurrence.<br><br>The meaning of the word is simply at-one-ment, i.e., the stateof being at one or being reconciled, so that atonement isreconciliation. Thus it is used to denote the effect which flowsfrom the death of Christ.<br><br>But the word is also used to denote that by which thisreconciliation is brought about, viz., the death of Christitself; and when so used it means satisfaction, and in thissense to make an atonement for one is to make satisfaction forhis offences (Ex. 32:30; Lev. 4:26; 5:16; Num. 6:11), and, asregards the person, to reconcile, to propitiate God in hisbehalf.<br><br>By the atonement of Christ we generally mean his work by whichhe expiated our sins. But in Scripture usage the word denotesthe reconciliation itself, and not the means by which it iseffected. When speaking of Christ\'s saving work, the word\"satisfaction,\" the word used by the theologians of theReformation, is to be preferred to the word \"atonement.\"Christ\'s satisfaction is all he did in the room and in behalf ofsinners to satisfy the demands of the law and justice of God.Christ\'s work consisted of suffering and obedience, and thesewere vicarious, i.e., were not merely for our benefit, but werein our stead, as the suffering and obedience of our vicar, orsubstitute. Our guilt is expiated by the punishment which ourvicar bore, and thus God is rendered propitious, i.e., it is nowconsistent with his justice to manifest his love totransgressors. Expiation has been made for sin, i.e., it iscovered. The means by which it is covered is vicarioussatisfaction, and the result of its being covered is atonementor reconciliation. To make atonement is to do that by virtue ofwhich alienation ceases and reconciliation is brought about.Christ\'s mediatorial work and sufferings are the ground orefficient cause of reconciliation with God. They rectify thedisturbed relations between God and man, taking away theobstacles interposed by sin to their fellowship and concord. Thereconciliation is mutual, i.e., it is not only that of sinnerstoward God, but also and pre-eminently that of God towardsinners, effected by the sin-offering he himself provided, sothat consistently with the other attributes of his character hislove might flow forth in all its fulness of blessing to men. Theprimary idea presented to us in different forms throughout theScripture is that the death of Christ is a satisfaction ofinfinite worth rendered to the law and justice of God (q.v.),and accepted by him in room of the very penalty man hadincurred. It must also be constantly kept in mind that theatonement is not the cause but the consequence of God\'s love toguilty men (John 3:16; Rom. 3:24, 25; Eph. 1:7; 1 John 1:9;4:9). The atonement may also be regarded as necessary, not in anabsolute but in a relative sense, i.e., if man is to be saved,there is no other way than this which God has devised andcarried out (Ex. 34:7; Josh. 24:19; Ps. 5:4; 7:11; Nahum 1:2, 6;Rom. 3:5).

But the sinsmust also be visibly banished, and therefore they weresymbolically laid by confession on the other goat, which wasthen \"sent away for Azazel\" into the wilderness.

It was importantthat the result of the sacrifices offered by the high priestalone in the sanctuary should be embodied in a visibletransaction, and hence the dismissal of the \"scape-goat.\" It wasof no consequence what became of it, as the whole import of thetransaction lay in its being sent into the wilderness bearingaway sin.

(434, 'Banquet', 'A feast provided for the entertainment of a company of guests(Esther 5; 7; 1 Pet. 4:3); such as was provided for our Lord byhis friends in Bethany (Matt. 26:6; Mark 14:3; comp. John 12:2).These meals were in the days of Christ usually called \"suppers,\"after the custom of the Romans, and were partaken of toward theclose of the day. It was usual to send a second invitation(Matt. 22:3; Luke 14:17) to those who had been already invited.When the whole company was assembled, the master of the houseshut the door with his own hands (Luke 13:25; Matt. 25:10).<br><br>The guests were first refreshed with water and fragrant oil(Luke 7:38; Mark 7:4). A less frequent custom was that ofsupplying each guest with a robe to be worn during the feast(Eccles. 9:8; Rev. 3:4, 5; Matt. 22:11). At private banquets themaster of the house presided; but on public occasions a\"governor of the feast\" was chosen (John 2:8). The guests wereplaced in order according to seniority (Gen. 43:33), oraccording to the rank they held (Prov. 25:6, 7; Matt. 23:6; Luke14:7).<br><br>As spoons and knives and forks are a modern invention, and werealtogether unknown in the East, the hands alone were necessarilyused, and were dipped in the dish, which was common to two ofthe guests (John 13:26). In the days of our Lord the guestsreclined at table; but the ancient Israelites sat around lowtables, cross-legged, like the modern Orientals. Guests werespecially honoured when extra portions were set before them(Gen. 43:34), and when their cup was filled with wine till itran over (Ps. 23:5). The hands of the guests were usuallycleaned by being rubbed on bread, the crumbs of which fell tothe ground, and were the portion for dogs (Matt. 15:27; Luke16:21).<br><br>At the time of the three annual festivals at Jerusalem familybanquets were common. To these the \"widow, and the fatherless,and the stranger\" were welcome (Deut. 16:11). Sacrifices alsoincluded a banquet (Ex. 34:15; Judg. 16:23). Birthday banquetsare mentioned (Gen. 40:20; Matt. 14:6). They were sometimesprotracted, and attended with revelry and excess (Gen. 21:8;29:22; 1 Sam. 25:2, 36; 2 Sam. 13:23). Portions were sometimessent from the table to poorer friends (Neh. 8:10; Esther 9:19,22). (See [46]MEALS.)<br><br>'),
(435, 'Baptism, Christian', 'An ordinance immediately instituted by Christ (Matt. 28:19, 20),and designed to be observed in the church, like that of theSupper, \"till he come.\" The words \"baptize\" and \"baptism\" aresimply Greek words transferred into English. This wasnecessarily done by the translators of the Scriptures, for noliteral translation could properly express all that is impliedin them.<br><br>The mode of baptism can in no way be determined from the Greekword rendered \"baptize.\" Baptists say that it means \"to dip,\"and nothing else. That is an incorrect view of the meaning ofthe word. It means both (1) to dip a thing into an element orliquid, and (2) to put an element or liquid over or on it.Nothing therefore as to the mode of baptism can be concludedfrom the mere word used. The word has a wide latitude ofmeaning, not only in the New Testament, but also in the LXX.Version of the Old Testament, where it is used of the ablutionsand baptisms required by the Mosaic law. These were effected byimmersion, and by affusion and sprinkling; and the same word,\"washings\" (Heb. 9:10, 13, 19, 21) or \"baptisms,\" designatesthem all. In the New Testament there cannot be found a singlewell-authenticated instance of the occurrence of the word whereit necessarily means immersion. Moreover, none of the instancesof baptism recorded in the Acts of the Apostles (2:38-41;8:26-39; 9:17, 18; 22:12-16; 10:44-48; 16:32-34) favours theidea that it was by dipping the person baptized, or byimmersion, while in some of them such a mode was highlyimprobable.<br><br>The gospel and its ordinances are designed for the whole world,and it cannot be supposed that a form for the administration ofbaptism would have been prescribed which would in any place (asin a tropical country or in polar regions) or under anycircumstances be inapplicable or injurious or impossible.<br><br>Baptism and the Lord\'s Supper are the two symbolical ordinancesof the New Testament. The Supper represents the work of Christ,and Baptism the work of the Spirit. As in the Supper a smallamount of bread and wine used in this ordinance exhibits insymbol the great work of Christ, so in Baptism the work of theHoly Spirit is fully seen in the water poured or sprinkled onthe person in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Thatwhich is essential in baptism is only \"washing with water,\" nomode being specified and none being necessary or essential tothe symbolism of the ordinance.<br><br>The apostles of our Lord were baptized with the Holy Ghost(Matt. 3:11) by his coming upon them (Acts 1:8). The fire alsowith which they were baptized sat upon them. The extraordinaryevent of Pentecost was explained by Peter as a fulfilment of theancient promise that the Spirit would be poured out in the lastdays (2:17). He uses also with the same reference the expressionshed forth as descriptive of the baptism of the Spirit (33). Inthe Pentecostal baptism \"the apostles were not dipped into theSpirit, nor plunged into the Spirit; but the Spirit was shedforth, poured out, fell on them (11:15), came upon them, sat onthem.\" That was a real and true baptism. We are warranted fromsuch language to conclude that in like manner when water ispoured out, falls, comes upon or rests upon a person when thisordinance is administered, that person is baptized. Baptism istherefore, in view of all these arguments \"rightly administeredby pouring or sprinkling water upon the person.\"<br><br>The subjects of baptism. This raises questions of greaterimportance than those relating to its mode.<br><br>1. The controversy here is not about \"believers\' baptism,\" forthat is common to all parties. Believers were baptized inapostolic times, and they have been baptized in all time by allthe branches of the church. It is altogether a misrepresentationto allege, as is sometimes done by Baptists, that their doctrineis \"believers\' baptism.\" Every instance of adult baptism, or of\"believers\' baptism,\" recorded in the New Testament (Acts 2:41;8:37; 9:17, 18; 10:47; 16:15; 19:5, etc.) is just such as wouldbe dealt with in precisely the same way by all branches of theProtestant Church, a profession of faith or of their being\"believers\" would be required from every one of them beforebaptism. The point in dispute is not the baptism of believers,but whether the infant children of believers, i.e., of membersof the church, ought to be baptized.<br><br>2. In support of the doctrine of infant baptism, i.e., of thebaptism of the infants, or rather the \"children,\" of believingparents, the following considerations may be adduced:<br><br>The Church of Christ exists as a divinely organized community.It is the \"kingdom of God,\" one historic kingdom under alldispensations. The commonwealth of Israel was the \"church\" (Acts7:38; Rom. 9:4) under the Mosaic dispensation. The New Testamentchurch is not a new and different church, but one with that ofthe Old Testament. The terms of admission into the church havealways been the same viz., a profession of faith and a promiseof subjection to the laws of the kingdom. Now it is a factbeyond dispute that the children of God\'s people under the olddispensation were recognized as members of the church.Circumcision was the sign and seal of their membership. It wasnot because of carnal descent from Abraham, but as being thechildren of God\'s professing people, that this rite wasadministered (Rom. 4:11). If children were members of the churchunder the old dispensation, which they undoubtedly were, thenthey are members of the church now by the same right, unless itcan be shown that they have been expressly excluded. Under theOld Testament parents acted for their children and representedthem. (See Gen. 9:9; 17:10; Ex. 24:7, 8; Deut. 29:9-13.) Whenparents entered into covenant with God, they brought theirchildren with them. This was a law in the Hebrew Church. When aproselyte was received into membership, he could not enterwithout bringing his children with him. The New Testament doesnot exclude the children of believers from the church. It doesnot deprive them of any privilege they enjoyed under the OldTestament. There is no command or statement of any kind, thatcan be interpreted as giving any countenance to such an idea,anywhere to be found in the New Testament. The church membershipof infants has never been set aside. The ancient practice,orginally appointed by God himself, must remain a law of hiskingdom till repealed by the same divine authority. There arelambs in the fold of the Good Shepherd (John 21:15; comp. Luke1:15; Matt. 19:14; 1 Cor. 7:14).<br><br>\"In a company of converts applying for admission into Christ\'shouse there are likely to be some heads of families. How istheir case to be treated? How, for example, are Lydia and herneighbour the keeper of the city prison to be treated? Both havebeen converted. Both are heads of families. They desire to bereceived into the infant church of Philippi. What is Christ\'sdirection to them? Shall we say that it is to this effect:\'Arise, and wash away your sins, and come into my house. But youmust come in by yourselves. These babes in your arms, you mustleave them outside. They cannot believe yet, and so they cannotcome in. Those other little ones by your side, their hearts mayperhaps have been touched with the love of God; still, they arenot old enough to make a personal profession, so they too mustbe left outside...For the present you must leave them where theyare and come in by yourselves.\' One may reasonably demand verystringent proofs before accepting this as a fair representationof the sort of welcome Christ offers to parents who come to hisdoor bringing their children with them. Surely it is moreconsonant with all we know about him to suppose that his welcomewill be more ample in its scope, and will breathe a moregracious tone. Surely it would be more like the Good Shepherd tosay, Come in, and bring your little ones along with you. Theyoungest needs my salvation; and the youngest is accessible tomy salvation. You may be unable as yet to deal with them abouteither sin or salvation, but my gracious power can find its wayinto their hearts even now. I can impart to them pardon and anew life. From Adam they have inherited sin and death; and I canso unite them to myself that in me they shall be heirs ofrighteousness and life. You may without misgiving bring them tome. And the law of my house requires that the same day whichwitnesses your reception into it by baptism must witness theirreception also\'\" (The Church, by Professor Binnie, D.D.).<br><br>'),
(436, 'Baptism for the dead', 'Only mentioned in 1 Cor. 15:29.

It was a voluntary act, the same as his actof becoming incarnate. Yet if the work he had engaged toaccomplish was to be completed, then it became him to take onhim the likeness of a sinner, and to fulfil all righteousness(Matt. 3:15).<br><br>The official duty of Christ and the sinless person of Christ areto be distinguished. It was in his official capacity that hesubmitted to baptism. In coming to John our Lord virtually said,\"Though sinless, and without any personal taint, yet in mypublic or official capacity as the Sent of God, I stand in theroom of many, and bring with me the sin of the world, for whichI am the propitiation.\" Christ was not made under the law on hisown account. It was as surety of his people, a position which hespontaneously assumed.

One was dated in the third year of theking Marduk-sar-uzur. As Marduk-sar-uzar was another name forBaal, this Marduk-sar-uzur was found to be the Belshazzar ofScripture.

(580, 'Bible', 'Bible, the English form of the Greek name Biblia, meaning\"books,\" the name which in the fifth century began to be givento the entire collection of sacred books, the \"Library of DivineRevelation.\" The name Bible was adopted by Wickliffe, and camegradually into use in our English language. The Bible consistsof sixty-six different books, composed by many differentwriters, in three different languages, under differentcircumstances; writers of almost every social rank, statesmenand peasants, kings, herdsmen, fishermen, priests,tax-gatherers, tentmakers; educated and uneducated, Jews andGentiles; most of them unknown to each other, and writing atvarious periods during the space of about 1600 years: and yet,after all, it is only one book dealing with only one subject inits numberless aspects and relations, the subject of man\'sredemption.<br><br>It is divided into the Old Testament, containing thirty-ninebooks, and the New Testament, containing twenty-seven books. Thenames given to the Old in the writings of the New are \"thescriptures\" (Matt. 21:42), \"scripture\" (2 Pet. 1:20), \"the holyscriptures\" (Rom. 1:2), \"the law\" (John 12:34), \"the law ofMoses, the prophets, and the psalms\" (Luke 24:44), \"the law andthe prophets\" (Matt. 5:17), \"the old covenant\" (2 Cor. 3:14,R.V.). There is a break of 400 years between the Old Testamentand the New. (See [68]APOCRYPHA.)<br><br>The Old Testament is divided into three parts:, 1. The Law(Torah), consisting of the Pentateuch, or five books of Moses.2. The Prophets, consisting of (1) the former, namely, Joshua,Judges, the Books of Samuel, and the Books of Kings; (2) thelatter, namely, the greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, andEzekiel, and the twelve minor prophets. 3. The Hagiographa, orholy writings, including the rest of the books. These wereranked in three divisions:, (1) The Psalms, Proverbs, and Job,distinguished by the Hebrew name, a word formed of the initialletters of these books, emeth, meaning truth. (2) Canticles,Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther, called the fiverolls, as being written for the synagogue use on five separaterolls. (3) Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 and 2 Chronicles.Between the Old and the New Testament no addition was made tothe revelation God had already given. The period of NewTestament revelation, extending over a century, began with theappearance of John the Baptist.<br><br>The New Testament consists of (1) the historical books, viz.,the Gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles; (2) the Epistles; and(3) the book of prophecy, the Revelation.<br><br>The division of the Bible into chapters and verses is altogetherof human invention, designed to facilitate reference to it. Theancient Jews divided the Old Testament into certain sections foruse in the synagogue service, and then at a later period, in theninth century A.D., into verses. Our modern system of chaptersfor all the books of the Bible was introduced by Cardinal Hugoabout the middle of the thirteenth century (he died 1263). Thesystem of verses for the New Testament was introduced byStephens in 1551, and generally adopted, although neitherTyndale\'s nor Coverdale\'s English translation of the Bible hasverses. The division is not always wisely made, yet it is veryuseful. (See [69]VERSION.)<br><br>'),
(581, 'Bier', 'The frame on which dead bodies were conveyed to the grave (Luke7:14).<br><br>'),
(582, 'Bigtha', 'Garden, or gift of fortune, one of the seven eunuchs orchamberlains who had charge of the harem of Ahasuerus (Esther1:10).<br><br>'),
(583, 'Bigthan', 'One of the eunuchs who \"kept the door\" in the court ofAhasuerus. With Teresh he conspired against the king\'s life.Mordecai detected the conspiracy, and the culprits were hanged(Esther 2:21-23; 6:1-3).<br><br>'),
(584, 'Bildad', 'Son of contention, one of Job\'s friends. He is called \"theShuhite,\" probably as belonging to Shuah, a district in Arabia,in which Shuah, the sixth son of Abraham by Keturah, settled(Gen. 25:2). He took part in each of the three controversiesinto which Job\'s friends entered with him (Job 8:1; 18:1; 25:1),and delivered three speeches, very severe and stern in theirtone, although less violent than those of Zophar, but more sothan those of Eliphaz.<br><br>'),
(585, 'Bilgah', 'Cheerful. (1.) The head of the fifteenth sacerdotal course forthe temple service (1 Chr. 24:14). (2.) A priest who returnedfrom Babylon with Zerubbabel (Neh. 12:5, 18).<br><br>'),

When offered insacrifice, they were not divided as other victims were (Gen.15:10). They are mentioned also as an article of food (Deut.14:11). The art of snaring wild birds is referred to (Ps. 124:7;Prov. 1:17; 7:23; Jer. 5:27). Singing birds are mentioned in Ps.104:12; Eccl. 12:4. Their timidity is alluded to (Hos. 11:11).The reference in Ps. 84:3 to the swallow and the sparrow may beonly a comparison equivalent to, \"What her house is to thesparrow, and her nest to the swallow, that thine altars are tomy soul.\"<br><br>'),
(589, 'Birsha', 'Son of wickedness, a king of Gomorrah whom Abraham succoured inthe invasion of Chedorlaomer (Gen. 14:2).<br><br>'),
(590, 'Birth', 'As soon as a child was born it was washed, and rubbed with salt(Ezek. 16:4), and then swathed with bandages (Job 38:9; Luke2:7, 12). A Hebrew mother remained forty days in seclusion afterthe birth of a son, and after the birth of a daughter doublethat number of days. At the close of that period she enteredinto the tabernacle or temple and offered up a sacrifice ofpurification (Lev. 12:1-8; Luke 2:22). A son was circumcised onthe eighth day after his birth, being thereby consecrated to God(Gen. 17:10-12; comp. Rom. 4:11). Seasons of misfortune arelikened to the pains of a woman in travail, and seasons ofprosperity to the joy that succeeds child-birth (Isa. 13:8; Jer.4:31; John 16:21, 22). The natural birth is referred to as theemblem of the new birth (John 3:3-8; Gal. 6:15; Titus 3:5,etc.).<br><br>'),
(591, 'Birth-day', 'The observance of birth-days was common in early times (Job 1:4,13, 18). They were specially celebrated in the land of Egypt(Gen. 40:20). There is no recorded instance in Scripture of thecelebration of birth-days among the Jews. On the occasion ofHerod\'s birth-day John the Baptist was beheaded (Matt. 14:6).<br><br>'),
(592, 'Birthright', '(1.) This word denotes the special privileges and advantagesbelonging to the first-born son among the Jews. He became thepriest of the family. Thus Reuben was the first-born of thepatriarchs, and so the priesthood of the tribes belonged to him.That honour was, however, transferred by God from Reuben to Levi(Num. 3:12, 13; 8:18).<br><br>(2.) The first-born son had allotted to him also a doubleportion of the paternal inheritance (Deut. 21:15-17). Reubenwas, because of his undutiful conduct, deprived of hisbirth-right (Gen. 49:4; 1 Chr. 5:1). Esau transferred hisbirth-right to Jacob (Gen. 25:33).<br><br>(3.) The first-born inherited the judicial authority of hisfather, whatever it might be (2 Chr. 21:3). By divineappointment, however, David excluded Adonijah in favour ofSolomon.<br><br>(4.) The Jews attached a sacred importance to the rank of\"first-born\" and \"first-begotten\" as applied to the Messiah(Rom. 8:29; Col. 1:18; Heb. 1:4-6). As first-born he has aninheritance superior to his brethren, and is the alone truepriest.<br><br>'),
(593, 'Bishop', 'An overseer. In apostolic times, it is quite manifest that therewas no difference as to order between bishops and elders orpresbyters (Acts 20:17-28; 1 Pet. 5:1, 2; Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3).The term bishop is never once used to denote a different officefrom that of elder or presbyter. These different names aresimply titles of the same office, \"bishop\" designating thefunction, namely, that of oversight, and \"presbyter\" the dignityappertaining to the office. Christ is figuratively called \"thebishop [episcopos] of souls\" (1 Pet. 2:25).<br><br>'),
(594, 'Bit', 'The curb put into the mouths of horses to restrain them. TheHebrew word (metheg) so rendered in Ps. 32:9 is elsewheretranslated \"bridle\" (2 Kings 19:28; Prov. 26:3; Isa. 37:29).Bits were generally made of bronze or iron, but sometimes alsoof gold or silver.

(595, 'Bith-ron', 'The broken or divided place, a district in the Arabah or Jordanvalley, on the east of the river (2 Sam. 2:29). It was probablythe designation of the region in general, which is broken andintersected by ravines.<br><br>'),
(596, 'Bithynia', 'A province in Asia Minor, to the south of the Euxine andPropontis. Christian congregations were here formed at an earlytime (1 Pet. 1:1). Paul was prevented by the Spirit fromentering this province (Acts 16:7). It is noted in churchhistory as the province ruled over by Pliny as Roman proconsul,who was perplexed as to the course he should take with thenumerous Christians brought before his tribunal on account oftheir profession of Christianity and their conduct, and wrote toTrajan, the emperor, for instructions (A.D. 107).<br><br>'),
(597, 'Bitter', 'Bitterness is symbolical of affliction, misery, and servitude(Ex. 1:14; Ruth 1:20; Jer. 9:15). The Chaldeans are called the\"bitter and hasty nation\" (Hab. 1:6). The \"gall of bitterness\"expresses a state of great wickedness (Acts 8:23). A \"root ofbitterness\" is a wicked person or a dangerous sin (Heb. 12:15).<br><br>The Passover was to be eaten with \"bitter herbs\" (Ex. 12:8; Num.9:11). The kind of herbs so designated is not known. Probablythey were any bitter herbs obtainable at the place and time whenthe Passover was celebrated. They represented the severity ofthe servitude under which the people groaned; and have beenregarded also as typical of the sufferings of Christ.<br><br>'),
(598, 'Bittern', 'Is found three times in connection with the desolations to comeupon Babylon, Idumea, and Nineveh (Isa. 14:23; 34:11; Zeph.2:14). This bird belongs to the class of cranes. Its scientificname is Botaurus stellaris. It is a solitary bird, frequentingmarshy ground. The Hebrew word (kippod) thus rendered in theAuthorized Version is rendered \"porcupine\" in the RevisedVersion. But in the passages noted the kippod is associated withbirds, with pools of water, and with solitude and desolation.This favours the idea that not the \"porcupine\" but the \"bittern\"is really intended by the word.<br><br>'),
(599, 'Bitumen', 'Gen. 11:3, R.V., margin, rendered in the A.V. \"slime\"), amineral pitch. With this the ark was pitched (6:14. See also Ex.2:3.) (See [70]SLIME.)<br><br>'),
(600, 'Black', 'Properly the absence of all colour. In Prov. 7:9 the Hebrew wordmeans, as in the margin of the Revised Version, \"the pupil ofthe eye.\" It is translated \"apple\" of the eye in Deut. 32:10;Ps. 17:8; Prov. 7:2. It is a different word which is rendered\"black\" in Lev. 13:31, 37; Cant. 1:5; 5:11; and Zech. 6:2, 6. Itis uncertain what the \"black marble\" of Esther 1:6 was whichformed a part of the mosaic pavement.<br><br>'),
(601, 'Blade', 'Applied to the glittering point of a spear (Job 39:23) or sword(Nah. 3:3), the blade of a dagger (Judg. 3:22); the \"shoulderblade\" (Job 31:22); the \"blade\" of cereals (Matt. 13:26).<br><br>'),
(602, 'Blains', 'Occurs only in connection with the sixth plague of Egypt (Ex.9:9, 10). In Deut. 28:27, 35, it is called \"the botch of Egypt.\"It seems to have been the fearful disease of black leprosy, akind of elephantiasis, producing burning ulcers.<br><br>'),
(603, 'Blasphemy', 'In the sense of speaking evil of God this word is found in Ps.74:18; Isa. 52:5; Rom. 2:24; Rev. 13:1, 6; 16:9, 11, 21. Itdenotes also any kind of calumny, or evil-speaking, or abuse (1Kings 21:10; Acts 13:45; 18:6, etc.). Our Lord was accused ofblasphemy when he claimed to be the Son of God (Matt. 26:65;comp. Matt. 9:3; Mark 2:7). They who deny his Messiahshipblaspheme Jesus (Luke 22:65; John 10:36).<br><br>Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (Matt. 12:31, 32; Mark 3:28,29; Luke 12:10) is regarded by some as a continued and obstinaterejection of the gospel, and hence is an unpardonable sin,simply because as long as a sinner remains in unbelief hevoluntarily excludes himself from pardon. Others regard theexpression as designating the sin of attributing to the power ofSatan those miracles which Christ performed, or generally thoseworks which are the result of the Spirit\'s agency.<br><br>'),
(604, 'Blastus', 'Chamberlain to king Herod Agrippa I. (Acts 12:20). Such personsgenerally had great influence with their masters.<br><br>'),
(605, 'Blemish', 'Imperfection or bodily deformity excluding men from thepriesthood, and rendering animals unfit to be offered insacrifice (Lev. 21:17-23; 22:19-25). The Christian church, asjustified in Christ, is \"without blemish\" (Eph. 5:27). Christoffered himself a sacrifice \"without blemish,\" acceptable to God(1 Pet. 1:19).<br><br>'),
(606, 'Bless', '(1.) God blesses his people when he bestows on them some gifttemporal or spiritual (Gen. 1:22; 24:35; Job 42:12; Ps. 45:2;104:24, 35).<br><br>(2.) We bless God when we thank him for his mercies (Ps. 103:1,2; 145:1, 2).<br><br>(3.) A man blesses himself when he invokes God\'s blessing (Isa.65:16), or rejoices in God\'s goodness to him (Deut. 29:19; Ps.49:18).<br><br>(4.) One blesses another when he expresses good wishes or offersprayer to God for his welfare (Gen. 24:60; 31:55; 1 Sam. 2:20).Sometimes blessings were uttered under divine inspiration, as inthe case of Noah, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses (Gen. 9:26, 27; 27:28,29, 40; 48:15-20; 49:1-28; Deut. 33). The priests were divinelyauthorized to bless the people (Deut. 10:8; Num. 6:22-27). Wehave many examples of apostolic benediction (2 Cor. 13:14; Eph.6:23, 24; 2 Thess. 3:16, 18; Heb. 13:20, 21; 1 Pet. 5:10, 11).<br><br>(5.) Among the Jews in their thank-offerings the master of thefeast took a cup of wine in his hand, and after having blessedGod for it and for other mercies then enjoyed, handed it to hisguests, who all partook of it. Ps. 116:13 refers to this custom.It is also alluded to in 1 Cor. 10:16, where the apostle speaksof the \"cup of blessing.\"<br><br>'),
(607, 'Blind', 'Blind beggars are frequently mentioned (Matt. 9:27; 12:22;20:30; John 5:3). The blind are to be treated with compassion(Lev. 19:14; Deut. 27:18). Blindness was sometimes a punishmentfor disobedience (1 Sam. 11:2; Jer. 39:7), sometimes the effectof old age (Gen. 27:1; 1 Kings 14:4; 1 Sam. 4:15). Conquerorssometimes blinded their captives (2 Kings 25:7; 1 Sam. 11:2).Blindness denotes ignorance as to spiritual things (Isa. 6:10;42:18, 19; Matt. 15:14; Eph. 4:18). The opening of the eyes ofthe blind is peculiar to the Messiah (Isa. 29:18). Elymas wassmitten with blindness at Paul\'s word (Acts 13:11).<br><br>'),
(608, 'Blood', '(1.) As food, prohibited in Gen. 9:4, where the use of animalfood is first allowed. Comp. Deut. 12:23; Lev. 3:17; 7:26;17:10-14. The injunction to abstain from blood is renewed in thedecree of the council of Jerusalem (Acts 15:29). It has beenheld by some, and we think correctly, that this law ofprohibition was only ceremonial and temporary; while othersregard it as still binding on all. Blood was eaten by theIsraelites after the battle of Gilboa (1 Sam. 14:32-34).<br><br>(2.) The blood of sacrifices was caught by the priest in abasin, and then sprinkled seven times on the altar; that of thepassover on the doorposts and lintels of the houses (Ex. 12;Lev. 4:5-7; 16:14-19). At the giving of the law (Ex. 24:8) theblood of the sacrifices was sprinkled on the people as well ason the altar, and thus the people were consecrated to God, orentered into covenant with him, hence the blood of the covenant(Matt. 26:28; Heb. 9:19, 20; 10:29; 13:20).<br><br>(3.) Human blood. The murderer was to be punished (Gen. 9:5).The blood of the murdered \"crieth for vengeance\" (Gen. 4:10).The \"avenger of blood\" was the nearest relative of the murdered,and he was required to avenge his death (Num. 35:24, 27). Nosatisfaction could be made for the guilt of murder (Num. 35:31).<br><br>(4.) Blood used metaphorically to denote race (Acts 17:26), andas a symbol of slaughter (Isa. 34:3). To \"wash the feet inblood\" means to gain a great victory (Ps. 58:10). Wine, from itsred colour, is called \"the blood of the grape\" (Gen. 49:11).Blood and water issued from our Saviour\'s side when it waspierced by the Roman soldier (John 19:34). This has ledpathologists to the conclusion that the proper cause of Christ\'sdeath was rupture of the heart. (Comp. Ps. 69:20.)<br><br>'),

(617, 'Bolled', '(Ex. 9:31), meaning \"swollen or podded for seed,\" was adopted inthe Authorized Version from the version of Coverdale (1535). TheRevised Version has in the margin \"was in bloom,\" which is themore probable rendering of the Hebrew word.

(662, 'Bulrush', '(1.) In Isa. 58:5 the rendering of a word which denotes\"belonging to a marsh,\" from the nature of the soil in which itgrows (Isa. 18:2). It was sometimes platted into ropes (Job.41:2; A.V., \"hook,\" R.V., \"rope,\" lit. \"cord of rushes\").<br><br>(2.) In Ex. 2:3, Isa. 18:2 (R.V., \"papyrus\") this word is thetranslation of the Hebrew gome, which designates the plant asabsorbing moisture. In Isa. 35:7 and Job 8:11 it is rendered\"rush.\" This was the Egyptian papyrus (papyrus Nilotica). It wasanciently very abundant in Egypt. The Egyptians made garmentsand shoes and various utensils of it. It was used for theconstruction of the ark of Moses (Ex. 2:3, 5). The root portionsof the stem were used for food. The inside bark was cut intostrips, which were sewed together and dried in the sun, formingthe papyrus used for writing.

The first commercial transaction recorded is that of thepurchase of a burial-place, for which Abraham weighed to Ephron\"four hundred shekels of silver current money with themerchants.\" Thus the patriarch became the owner of a part of theland of Canaan, the only part he ever possessed. When he himselfdied, \"his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave ofMachpelah,\" beside Sarah his wife (Gen. 25:9).<br><br>Deborah, Rebekah\'s nurse, was buried under Allon-bachuth, \"theoak of weeping\" (Gen. 35:8), near to Bethel. Rachel died, andwas buried near Ephrath; \"and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave\"(16-20). Isaac was buried at Hebron, where he had died (27, 29).Jacob, when charging his sons to bury him in the cave ofMachpelah, said, \"There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife;there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buriedLeah\" (49:31). In compliance with the oath which he made himswear unto him (47:29-31), Joseph, assisted by his brethren,buried Jacob in the cave of Machpelah (50:2, 13). At the Exodus,Moses \"took the bones of Joseph with him,\" and they were buriedin the \"parcel of ground\" which Jacob had bought of the sons ofHamor (Josh. 24:32), which became Joseph\'s inheritance (Gen.48:22; 1 Chr. 5:1; John 4:5). Two burials are mentioned ashaving taken place in the wilderness. That of Miriam (Num.20:1), and that of Moses, \"in the land of Moab\" (Deut. 34:5, 6,8). There is no account of the actual burial of Aaron, whichprobably, however, took place on the summit of Mount Hor (Num.20:28, 29).<br><br>Joshua was buried \"in the border of his inheritance inTimnath-serah\" (Josh. 24: 30).<br><br>In Job we find a reference to burying-places, which wereprobably the Pyramids (3:14, 15).

The same practice is again referred to by Amos(6:10).<br><br>Absalom was buried \"in the wood\" where he was slain (2 Sam.18:17, 18). The raising of the heap of stones over his grave wasintended to mark abhorrence of the person buried (comp. Josh.7:26 and 8:29). There was no fixed royal burying-place for theHebrew kings. We find several royal burials taking place,however, \"in the city of David\" (1 Kings 2:10; 11:43; 15:8; 2Kings 14:19, 20; 15:38; 1 Kings 14:31; 22:50; 2 Chr. 21:19, 20;2 Chr. 24:25, etc.).

According tosome its original name was Baal-Gad (Josh. 11:17), orBaal-Hermon (Judg. 3:3; 1 Chr. 5:23), when it was a Canaanitesanctuary of Baal. It was afterwards called Panium or Paneas,from a deep cavern full of water near the town. This name wasgiven to the cavern by the Greeks of the Macedonian kingdom ofAntioch because of its likeness to the grottos of Greece, whichwere always associated with the worship of their god Pan. Itsmodern name is Banias. Here Herod built a temple, which hededicated to Augustus Caesar. This town was afterwards enlargedand embellished by Herod Philip, the tetrarch of Trachonitis, ofwhose territory it formed a part, and was called by him CaesareaPhilippi, partly after his own name, and partly after that ofthe emperor Tiberius Caesar.

(682, 'Caesarea', '(Palestinae), a city on the shore of the Mediterranean, on thegreat road from Tyre to Egypt, about 70 miles northwest ofJerusalem, at the northern extremity of the plain of Sharon. Itwas built by Herod the Great (B.C. 10), who named it afterCaesar Augustus, hence called Caesarea Sebaste (Gr. Sebastos =\"Augustus\"), on the site of an old town called \"Strato\'s Tower.\"It was the capital of the Roman province of Judaea, the seat ofthe governors or procurators, and the headquarters of the Romantroops. It was the great Gentile city of Palestine, with aspacious artificial harbour. It was adorned with many buildingsof great splendour, after the manner of the Roman cities of theWest. Here Cornelius the centurion was converted through theinstrumentality of Peter (Acts 10:1, 24), and thus for the firsttime the door of faith was opened to the Gentiles. Philip theevangelist resided here with his four daughters (21:8). Fromthis place Saul sailed for his native Tarsus when forced to fleefrom Jerusalem (9:30), and here he landed when returning fromhis second missionary journey (18:22). He remained as a prisonerhere for two years before his voyage to Rome (Acts 24:27; 25:1,4, 6, 13). Here on a \"set day,\" when games were celebrated inthe theatre in honour of the emperor Claudius, Herod Agrippa I.appeared among the people in great pomp, and in the midst of theidolatrous homage paid to him was suddenly smitten by an angel,and carried out a dying man. He was \"eaten of worms\" (12:19-23),thus perishing by the same loathsome disease as his granfather,Herod the Great.

He held this office during thewhole of Pilate\'s administration. His wife was the daughter ofAnnas, who had formerly been high priest, and was probably thevicar or deputy (Heb. sagan) of Caiaphas. He was of the sect ofthe Sadducees (Acts 5:17), and was a member of the council whenhe gave his opinion that Jesus should be put to death \"for thepeople, and that the whole nation perish not\" (John 11:50). Inthese words he unconsciously uttered a prophecy. \"Like Saul, hewas a prophet in spite of himself.\" Caiaphas had no power toinflict the punishment of death, and therefore Jesus was sent toPilate, the Roman governor, that he might duly pronounce thesentence against him (Matt. 27:2; John 18:28).

Abel\'s offeringwas of the \"firstlings of his flock and of the fat,\" whileCain\'s was \"of the fruit of the ground.\" Abel\'s sacrifice was\"more excellent\" (Heb. 11:4) than Cain\'s, and was accepted byGod. On this account Cain was \"very wroth,\" and cherishedfeelings of murderous hatred against his brother, and was atlength guilty of the desperate outrage of putting him to death(1 John 3:12). For this crime he was expelled from Eden, andhenceforth led the life of an exile, bearing upon him some markwhich God had set upon him in answer to his own cry for mercy,so that thereby he might be protected from the wrath of hisfellow-men; or it may be that God only gave him some sign toassure him that he would not be slain (Gen. 4:15). Doomed to bea wanderer and a fugitive in the earth, he went forth into the\"land of Nod\", i.e., the land of \"exile\", which is said to havebeen in the \"east of Eden,\" and there he built a city, the firstwe read of, and called it after his son\'s name, Enoch. Hisdescendants are enumerated to the sixth generation. Theygradually degenerated in their moral and spiritual conditiontill they became wholly corrupt before God.

The word designates an Oriental plantcalled the \"sweet flag,\" the Acorus calamus of Linnaeus. It iselsewhere called \"sweet cane\" (Isa. 43:24; Jer. 6:20). It has anaromatic smell, and when its knotted stalk is cut and dried andreduced to powder, it forms an ingredient in the most preciousperfumes.

It came to be applied to the Scriptures, to denotethat they contained the authoritative rule of faith andpractice, the standard of doctrine and duty. A book is said tobe of canonical authority when it has a right to take a placewith the other books which contain a revelation of the Divinewill. Such a right does not arise from any ecclesiasticalauthority, but from the evidence of the inspired authorship ofthe book. The canonical (i.e., the inspired) books of the Oldand New Testaments, are a complete rule, and the only rule, offaith and practice. They contain the whole supernaturalrevelation of God to men. The New Testament Canon was formedgradually under divine guidance. The different books as theywere written came into the possession of the Christianassociations which began to be formed soon after the day ofPentecost; and thus slowly the canon increased till all thebooks were gathered together into one collection containing thewhole of the twenty-seven New Testament inspired books.Historical evidence shows that from about the middle of thesecond century this New Testament collection was substantiallysuch as we now possess. Each book contained in it is proved tohave, on its own ground, a right to its place; and thus thewhole is of divine authority.<br><br>The Old Testament Canon is witnessed to by the New Testamentwriters.

The Septuagint Version (q.v.) also containedevery book we now have in the Old Testament Scriptures.

Samaria was never again inhabited by theIsraelites. The families thus removed were carried to distantcities, many of them not far from the Caspian Sea, and theirplace was supplied by colonists from Babylon and Cuthah, etc. (2Kings 17:24). Thus terminated the kingdom of the ten tribes,after a separate duration of two hundred and fifty-five years(B.C. 975-721).<br><br>Many speculations have been indulged in with reference to theseten tribes. But we believe that all, except the number thatprobably allied themselves with Judah and shared in theirrestoration under Cyrus, are finally lost.<br><br>\"Like the dew on the mountain, Like the foam on the river, Likethe bubble on the fountain, They are gone, and for ever.\"<br><br>(2.) Of Judah. In the third year of Jehoiachim, the eighteenthking of Judah (B.C. 605), Nebuchadnezzar having overcome theEgyptians at Carchemish, advanced to Jerusalem with a greatarmy. After a brief siege he took that city, and carried awaythe vessels of the sanctuary to Babylon, and dedicated them inthe Temple of Belus (2 Kings 24:1; 2 Chr. 36:6, 7; Dan. 1:1, 2).He also carried away the treasures of the king, whom he made hisvassal. At this time, from which is dated the \"seventy years\" ofcaptivity (Jer. 25; Dan. 9:1, 2), Daniel and his companions werecarried to Babylon, there to be brought up at the court andtrained in all the learning of the Chaldeans. After this, in thefifth year of Jehoiakim, a great national fast was appointed(Jer. 36:9), during which the king, to show his defiance, cut upthe leaves of the book of Jeremiah\'s prophecies as they wereread to him in his winter palace, and threw them into the fire.In the same spirit he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings24:1), who again a second time (B.C. 598) marched againstJerusalem, and put Jehoiachim to death, placing his sonJehoiachin on the throne in his stead. But Jehoiachin\'scounsellors displeasing Nebuchadnezzar, he again a third timeturned his army against Jerusalem, and carried away to Babylon asecond detachment of Jews as captives, to the number of 10,000(2 Kings 24:13; Jer. 24:1; 2 Chr. 36:10), among whom were theking, with his mother and all his princes and officers, alsoEzekiel, who with many of his companions were settled on thebanks of the river Chebar (q.v.). He also carried away all theremaining treasures of the temple and the palace, and the goldenvessels of the sanctuary.<br><br>Mattaniah, the uncle of Jehoiachin, was now made king over whatremained of the kingdom of Judah, under the name of Zedekiah (2Kings 24:17; 2 Chr. 36:10). After a troubled reign of elevenyears his kingdom came to an end (2 Chr. 36:11). Nebuchadnezzar,with a powerful army, besieged Jerusalem, and Zedekiah became aprisoner in Babylon. His eyes were put out, and he was kept inclose confinement till his death (2 Kings 25:7). The city wasspoiled of all that was of value, and then given up to theflames. The temple and palaces were consumed, and the walls ofthe city were levelled with the ground (B.C. 586), and all thatremained of the people, except a number of the poorest class whowere left to till the ground and dress the vineyards, werecarried away captives to Babylon. This was the third and lastdeportation of Jewish captives. The land was now utterlydesolate, and was abondoned to anarchy.<br><br>In the first year of his reign as king of Babylon (B.C. 536),Cyrus issued a decree liberating the Jewish captives, andpermitting them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the city andthe temple (2 Chr. 36:22, 23; Ezra 1; 2). The number of thepeople forming the first caravan, under Zerubbabel, amounted inall to 42,360 (Ezra 2:64, 65), besides 7,337 men-servants andmaid-servants. A considerable number, 12,000 probably, from theten tribes who had been carried away into Assyria no doubtcombined with this band of liberated captives.<br><br>At a later period other bands of the Jews returned (1) underEzra (7:7) (B.C. 458), and (2) Nehemiah (7:66) (B.C. 445). Butthe great mass of the people remained still in the land to whichthey had been carried, and became a portion of the Jews of the\"dispersion\" (John 7:35; 1 Pet. 1:1). The whole number of theexiles that chose to remain was probably about six times thenumber of those who returned.<br><br>'),

It was the capital of the kingdom of the northernHittites. The Babylonian army, under Nebuchadnezzar, the son ofNabopolassar, here met and conquered the army of Pharaoh-necho,king of Egypt (B.C. 607).

In Isa. 46:1 (R.V., \"the things that ye carriedabout\") the word means a load for a beast of burden. In 1 Sam.17:22 and Isa. 10:28 it is the rendering of a word (\"stuff\" in 1Sam. 10:22) meaning implements, equipments, baggage.

They may be classifiedas,<br><br>(1.) Neat cattle. Many hundreds of these were yearly consumed insacrifices or used for food. The finest herds were found inBashan, beyond Jordan (Num. 32:4). Large herds also pastured onthe wide fertile plains of Sharon. They were yoked to the plough(1 Kings 19:19), and were employed for carrying burdens (1 Chr.12:40). They were driven with a pointed rod (Judg. 3:31) or goad(q.v.).<br><br>According to the Mosaic law, the mouths of cattle employed forthe threshing-floor were not to be muzzled, so as to preventthem from eating of the provender over which they trampled(Deut. 25:4).

They arefrequently mentioned among the booty taken in war (Num. 31:32;Josh. 6:21; 1 Sam. 14:32; 15:3). There were many who were ownersof large flocks (1 Sam. 25:2; 2 Sam. 12:2, comp. Job 1:3). Kingsalso had shepherds \"over their flocks\" (1 Chr. 27:31), fromwhich they derived a large portion of their revenue (2 Sam.17:29; 1 Chr. 12:40). The districts most famous for their flocksof sheep were the plain of Sharon (Isa. 65: 10), Mount Carmel(Micah 7:14), Bashan and Gilead (Micah 7:14). In patriarchaltimes the flocks of sheep were sometimes tended by the daughtersof the owners. Thus Rachel, the daughter of Laban, kept herfather\'s sheep (Gen. 29:9); as also Zipporah and her six sistershad charge of their father Jethro\'s flocks (Ex. 2:16). Sometimesthey were kept by hired shepherds (John 10:12), and sometimes bythe sons of the family (1 Sam. 16:11; 17:15). The keepers sofamiliarized their sheep with their voices that they knew them,and followed them at their call. Sheep, but more especially ramsand lambs, were frequently offered in sacrifice. The shearing ofsheep was a great festive occasion (1 Sam. 25:4; 2 Sam. 13:23).They were folded at night, and guarded by their keepers againstthe attacks of the lion (Micah 5:8), the bear (1 Sam. 17:34),and the wolf (Matt. 10:16; John 10:12).

Anothercensus was made just before the entrance into Canaan, when thenumber was found to be 601,730, showing thus a small decrease(Num. 26:51). (3.) The next census was in the time of David,when the number, exclusive of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin,was found to be 1,300,000 (2 Sam. 24:9; 1 Chr. 21:5). (4.)Solomon made a census of the foreigners in the land, and found153,600 able-bodied workmen (2 Chr. 2:17, 18). (5.)

Chaff is used as a figureof abortive wickedness (Ps. 1:4; Matt. 3:12). False doctrinesare also called chaff (Jer. 23:28), or more correctly rendered\"chopped straw.\" The destruction of the wicked, and theirpowerlessness, are likened to the carrying away of chaff by thewind (Isa. 17:13; Hos. 13:3; Zeph. 2:2).<br><br>'),

The name of this stone isderived from Chalcedon, where it is said to have been firstdiscovered. In modern mineralogy this is the name of anagate-like quartz of a bluish colour. Pliny so names the Indianruby. The mineral intended in Revelation is probably the Hebrewnophekh, translated \"emerald\" (Ex. 28:18; 39:11; Ezek. 27:16;28:13).

Ur was one ofthe oldest and most famous of the Babylonian cities. Its site isnow called Mugheir, or Mugayyar, on the western bank of theEuphrates, in Southern Babylonia. About a century before thebirth of Abram it was ruled by a powerful dynasty of kings.Their conquests extended to Elam on the one side, and to theLebanon on the other. They were followed by a dynasty of princeswhose capital was Babylon, and who seem to have been of SouthArabian origin. The founder of the dynasty was Sumu-abi (\"Shemis my father\"). But soon afterwards Babylonia fell under Elamitedominion. The kings of Babylon were compelled to acknowledge thesupremacy of Elam, and a rival kingdom to that of Babylon, andgoverned by Elamites, sprang up at Larsa, not far from Ur, buton the opposite bank of the river. In the time of Abram the kingof Larsa was Eri-Aku, the son of an Elamite prince, and Eri-Aku,as has long been recognized, is the Biblical \"Arioch king ofEllasar\" (Gen. 14:1).

It is the Aramaic dialect, as it is sometimescalled, as distinguished from the Hebrew dialect. It was thelanguage of commerce and of social intercourse in Western Asia,and after the Exile gradually came to be the popular language ofPalestine. It is called \"Syrian\" in 2 Kings 18:26. Some isolatedwords in this language are preserved in the New Testament (Matt.5:22; 6:24; 16:17; 27:46; Mark 3:17; 5:41; 7:34; 14:36; Acts1:19; 1 Cor. 16:22).

These men cultivated the ancientCushite language of the original inhabitants of the land, forthey had a \"learning\" and a \"tongue\" (1:4) of their own. Thecommon language of the country at that time had becomeassimilated to the Semitic dialect, especially through theinfluence of the Assyrians, and was the language that was usedfor all civil purposes. The Chaldeans were the learned class,interesting themselves in science and religion, which consisted,like that of the ancient Arabians and Syrians, in the worship ofthe heavenly bodies.

Toenter into a chamber is used metaphorically of prayer andcommunion with God (Isa. 26:20). The \"chambers of the south\"(Job 9:9) are probably the constelations of the southernhemisphere.

He is almost the only convert from the higherranks of whom mention is made (comp. Acts 17:34). Blastus,Herod\'s \"chamberlain\" (Acts 12:20), was his personal attendantor valet-de-chambre.

But if the prophet\'s interview with Ahab was inSamaria, and he thence journeyed toward the east, it is probablethat he crossed Jordan and found refuge in some of the ravinesof Gilead. The \"brook\" is said to have been \"before Jordan,\"which probably means that it opened toward that river, intowhich it flowed.

This is he \"of whom Moses in the law andthe prophets did write.\" The Old Testament Scripture is full ofprophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and thework he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus the GreatDeliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men. This namedenotes that Jesus was divinely appointed, commissioned, andaccredited as the Saviour of men (Heb. 5:4; Isa. 11:2-4; 49:6;John 5:37; Acts 2:22).<br><br>To believe that \"Jesus is the Christ\" is to believe that he isthe Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent ofGod, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be.

They bore the title in theMassoretic Hebrew Dibre hayyamim, i.e., \"Acts of the Days.\" Thistitle was rendered by Jerome in his Latin version \"Chronicon,\"and hence \"Chronicles.\" In the Septuagint version the book isdivided into two, and bears the title Paraleipomena, i.e.,\"things omitted,\" or \"supplements\", because containing manythings omitted in the Books of Kings.<br><br>The contents of these books are comprehended under four heads.(1.) The first nine chapters of Book I. contain little more thana list of genealogies in the line of Israel down to the time ofDavid. (2.) The remainder of the first book contains a historyof the reign of David. (3.) The first nine chapters of Book II.contain the history of the reign of Solomon. (4.) The remainingchapters of the second book contain the history of the separatekingdom of Judah to the time of the return from BabylonianExile.<br><br>The time of the composition of the Chronicles was, there isevery ground to conclude, subsequent to the Babylonian Exile,probably between 450 and 435 B.C. The contents of this twofoldbook, both as to matter and form, correspond closely with thisidea. The close of the book records the proclamation of Cyruspermitting the Jews to return to their own land, and this formsthe opening passage of the Book of Ezra, which must be viewed asa continuation of the Chronicles. The peculiar form of thelanguage, being Aramaean in its general character, harmonizesalso with that of the books which were written after the Exile.The author was certainly contemporary with Zerubbabel, detailsof whose family history are given (1 Chr. 3:19).<br><br>The time of the composition being determined, the question ofthe authorship may be more easily decided. According to Jewishtradition, which was universally received down to the middle ofthe seventeenth century, Ezra was regarded as the author of theChronicles. There are many points of resemblance and of contactbetween the Chronicles and the Book of Ezra which seem toconfirm this opinion. The conclusion of the one and thebeginning of the other are almost identical in expression. Intheir spirit and characteristics they are the same, showing thusalso an identity of authorship.<br><br>In their general scope and design these books are not so muchhistorical as didactic. The principal aim of the writer appearsto be to present moral and religious truth. He does not giveprominence to political occurences, as is done in Samuel andKings, but to ecclesiastical institutions. \"The genealogies, souninteresting to most modern readers, were really an importantpart of the public records of the Hebrew state. They were thebasis on which not only the land was distributed and held, butthe public services of the temple were arranged and conducted,the Levites and their descendants alone, as is well known, beingentitled and first fruits set apart for that purpose.\" The\"Chronicles\" are an epitome of the sacred history from the daysof Adam down to the return from Babylonian Exile, a period ofabout 3,500 years. The writer gathers up \"the threads of the oldnational life broken by the Captivity.\"<br><br>The sources whence the chronicler compiled his work were publicrecords, registers, and genealogical tables belonging to theJews. These are referred to in the course of the book (1 Chr.27:24; 29:29; 2 Chr. 9:29; 12:15; 13:22; 20:34; 24:27; 26:22;32:32; 33:18, 19; 27:7; 35:25). There are in Chronicles, and thebooks of Samuel and Kings, forty parallels, often verbal,proving that the writer both knew and used these records (1 Chr.17:18; comp. 2 Sam. 7:18-20; 1 Chr. 19; comp. 2 Sam. 10, etc.).<br><br>As compared with Samuel and Kings, the Book of Chronicles omitsmany particulars there recorded (2 Sam. 6:20-23; 9; 11; 14-19,etc.), and includes many things peculiar to itself (1 Chr. 12;22; 23-26; 27; 28; 29, etc.). Twenty whole chapters, andtwenty-four parts of chapters, are occupied with matter notfound elsewhere. It also records many things in fuller detail,as (e.g.) the list of David\'s heroes (1 Chr. 12:1-37), theremoval of the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Mount Zion (1 Chr. 13;15:2-24; 16:4-43; comp. 2 Sam. 6), Uzziah\'s leprosy and itscause (2 Chr. 26:16-21; comp. 2 Kings 15:5), etc.<br><br>It has also been observed that another peculiarity of the bookis that it substitutes modern and more common expressions forthose that had then become unusual or obsolete. This is seenparticularly in the substitution of modern names of places, suchas were in use in the writer\'s day, for the old names; thusGezer (1 Chr. 20:4) is used instead of Gob (2 Sam. 21:18), etc.<br><br>The Books of Chronicles are ranked among the khethubim orhagiographa.

(824, 'Chronology', 'Is the arrangement of facts and events in the order of time. Thewriters of the Bible themselves do not adopt any standard eraaccording to which they date events. Sometimes the years arereckoned, e.g., from the time of the Exodus (Num. 1:1; 33:38; 1Kings 6:1), and sometimes from the accession of kings (1 Kings15:1, 9, 25, 33, etc.), and sometimes again from the return fromExile (Ezra 3:8).<br><br>Hence in constructing a system of Biblecal chronology, the planhas been adopted of reckoning the years from the ages of thepatriarchs before the birth of their first-born sons for theperiod from the Creation to Abraham. After this period otherdata are to be taken into account in determining the relativesequence of events.<br><br>As to the patriarchal period, there are three principal systemsof chronology: (1) that of the Hebrew text, (2) that of theSeptuagint version, and (3) that of the Samaritan Pentateuch, asseen in the scheme on the opposite page.<br><br>The Samaritan and the Septuagint have considerably modified theHebrew chronology. This modification some regard as having beenwilfully made, and to be rejected. The same system of variationsis observed in the chronology of the period between the Floodand Abraham. Thus:<br><br>| Hebrew Septuigant Samaritan | From the birth of | Arphaxad, 2years | after the Flood, to | the birth of Terah. 220 1000 870 |From the birth of | Terah to the birth | of Abraham. 130 70 72<br><br>The Septuagint fixes on seventy years as the age of Terah at thebirth of Abraham, from Gen. 11:26; but a comparison of Gen.11:32 and Acts 7:4 with Gen. 12:4 shows that when Terah died, atthe age of two hundred and five years, Abraham was seventy-fiveyears, and hence Terah must have been one hundred and thirtyyears when Abraham was born. Thus, including the two years fromthe Flood to the birth of Arphaxad, the period from the Flood tothe birth of Abraham was three hundred and fifty-two years.<br><br>The next period is from the birth of Abraham to the Exodus.This, according to the Hebrew, extends to five hundred and fiveyears. The difficulty here is as to the four hundred and thirtyyears mentioned Ex. 12:40, 41; Gal. 3:17. These years areregarded by some as dating from the covenant with Abraham (Gen.15), which was entered into soon after his sojourn in Egypt;others, with more probability, reckon these years from Jacob\'sgoing down into Egypt.

It ismentioned among the countries which took part in the attack uponEgypt in the reign of Rameses III. (of the Twentieth Dynasty),but as its king is not one of the princes stated to have beenconquered by the Pharaoh, it would seem that he did not actuallyenter Egypt. As the reign of Rameses III. corresponds with theIsraelitish occupation of Canaan, it is probable that theEgyptian monuments refer to the oppression of the Israelites byChushan-rishathaim. Canaan was still regarded as a province ofEgypt, so that, in attacking it Chushan-rishathaim would havebeen considered to be attacking Egypt.<br><br>'),
(831, 'Cilicia', 'A maritime province in the south-east of Asia Minor. Tarsus, thebirth-place of Paul, was one of its chief towns, and the seat ofa celebrated school of philosophy. Its luxurious climateattracted to it many Greek residents after its incorporationwith the Macedonian empire. It was formed into a Roman province,B.C. 67. The Jews of Cilicia had a synagogue at Jerusalem (Acts6:9). Paul visited it soon after his conversion (Gal. 1:21; Acts9:30), and again, on his second missionary journey (15:41), \"hewent through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.\" It wasfamous for its goat\'s-hair cloth, called cilicium.

There is no trace of it in Egypt,and it was unknown in Syria. The inner rind when dried androlled into cylinders forms the cinnamon of commerce. The fruitand coarser pieces of bark when boiled yield a fragrant oil. Itwas one of the principal ingredients in the holy anointing oil(Ex. 30:23). It is mentioned elsewhere only in Prov. 7:17; Cant.4:14; Rev. 18:13. The mention of it indicates a very early andextensive commerce carried on between Palestine and the East.<br><br>'),
(833, 'Cinnereth', 'A harp, one of the \"fenced cities\" of Naphtali (Josh. 19:35;comp. Deut. 3:17).

(835, 'Circumcision', 'Cutting around. This rite, practised before, as some think, bydivers races, was appointed by God to be the special badge ofhis chosen people, an abiding sign of their consecration to him.It was established as a national ordinance (Gen. 17:10, 11). Incompliance with the divine command, Abraham, though ninety-nineyears of age, was circumcised on the same day with Ishmael, whowas thirteen years old (17:24-27). Slaves, whether home-born orpurchased, were circumcised (17:12, 13); and all foreigners musthave their males circumcised before they could enjoy theprivileges of Jewish citizenship (Ex. 12:48). During the journeythrough the wilderness, the practice of circumcision fell intodisuse, but was resumed by the command of Joshua before theyentered the Promised Land (Josh. 5:2-9). It was observed alwaysafterwards among the tribes of israel, although it is notexpressly mentioned from the time of the settlement in Canaantill the time of Christ, about 1,450 years. The Jews pridedthemselves in the possession of this covenant distinction (Judg.14:3; 15:18; 1 Sam. 14:6; 17:26; 2 Sam. 1:20; Ezek. 31:18).<br><br>As a rite of the church it ceased when the New Testament timesbegan (Gal. 6:15; Col. 3:11). Some Jewish Christians sought toimpose it, however, on the Gentile converts; but this theapostles resolutely resisted (Acts 15:1; Gal. 6:12). Our Lordwas circumcised, for it \"became him to fulfil allrighteousness,\" as of the seed of Abraham, according to theflesh; and Paul \"took and circumcised\" Timothy (Acts 16:3), toavoid giving offence to the Jews. It would render Timothy\'slabours more acceptable to the Jews. But Paul would by no meansconsent to the demand that Titus should be circumcised (Gal.2:3-5). The great point for which he contended was the freeadmission of uncircumcised Gentiles into the church. Hecontended successfully in behalf of Titus, even in Jerusalem.<br><br>In the Old Testament a spiritual idea is attached tocircumcision. It was the symbol of purity (Isa. 52:1). We readof uncircumcised lips (Ex. 6:12, 30), ears (Jer. 6:10), hearts(Lev. 26:41). The fruit of a tree that is unclean is spoken ofas uncircumcised (Lev. 19:23).<br><br>It was a sign and seal of the covenant of grace as well as ofthe national covenant between God and the Hebrews. (1.) Itsealed the promises made to Abraham, which related to thecommonwealth of Israel, national promises. (2.) But the promisesmade to Abraham included the promise of redemption (Gal. 3:14),a promise which has come upon us. The covenant with Abraham wasa dispensation or a specific form of the covenant of grace, andcircumcision was a sign and seal of that covenant. It had aspiritual meaning. It signified purification of the heart,inward circumcision effected by the Spirit (Deut. 10:16; 30:6;Ezek. 44:7; Acts 7:51; Rom. 2:28; Col. 2:11). Circumcision as asymbol shadowing forth sanctification by the Holy Spirit has nowgiven way to the symbol of baptism (q.v.). But the truthembodied in both ordinances is ever the same, the removal ofsin, the sanctifying effects of grace in the heart.<br><br>Under the Jewish dispensation, church and state were identical.No one could be a member of the one without also being a memberof the other. Circumcision was a sign and seal of membership inboth. Every circumcised person bore thereby evidence that he wasone of the chosen people, a member of the church of God as itthen existed, and consequently also a member of the Jewishcommonwealth.<br><br>'),

Cisterns are frequently mentioned inScripture. The scarcity of springs in Palestine made itnecessary to collect rain-water in reservoirs and cisterns (Num.21:22). (See [117]WELL.)<br><br>Empty cisterns were sometimes used as prisons (Jer. 38:6; Lam.3:53; Ps. 40:2; 69:15). The \"pit\" into which Joseph was cast(Gen. 37:24) was a beer or dry well.

This \"freedom\" securedprivileges equal to those enjoyed by natives of Rome. Among themost notable of these was the provision that a man could not bebound or imprisoned without a formal trial (Acts 22:25, 26), orscourged (16:37).

The earliestdescription of a city is that of Sodom (19:1-22). Damascus issaid to be the oldest existing city in the world. Before thetime of Abraham there were cities in Egypt (Num. 13:22). TheIsraelites in Egypt were employed in building the \"treasurecities\" of Pithom and Raamses (Ex. 1:11); but it does not seemthat they had any cities of their own in Goshen (Gen. 46:34;47:1-11). In the kingdom of Og in Bashan there were sixty \"greatcities with walls,\" and twenty-three cities in Gilead partlyrebuilt by the tribes on the east of Jordan (Num. 21:21, 32, 33,35; 32:1-3, 34-42; Deut. 3:4, 5, 14; 1 Kings 4:13).

A \"cloudwithout rain\" is a proverbial saying, denoting a man who doesnot keep his promise (Prov. 16:15; Isa. 18:4; 25:5; Jude 1:12).A cloud is the figure of that which is transitory (Job 30:15;Hos. 6:4). A bright cloud is the symbolical seat of the Divinepresence (Ex. 29:42, 43; 1 Kings 8:10; 2 Chr. 5:14; Ezek. 43:4),and was called the Shechinah (q.v.).

Falseteachers are likened unto clouds carried about with a tempest (2Pet. 2:17). The infirmities of old age, which come one afteranother, are compared by Solomon to \"clouds returning after therain\" (Eccl. 12:2).

(867, 'Colossians, Epistle to the', 'Was written by Paul at Rome during his first imprisonment there(Acts 28:16, 30), probably in the spring of A.D. 57, or, as somethink, 62, and soon after he had written his Epistle to theEphesians. Like some of his other epistles (e.g., those toCorinth), this seems to have been written in consequence ofinformation which had somehow been conveyed to him of theinternal state of the church there (Col. 1:4-8). Its object wasto counteract false teaching. A large part of it is directedagainst certain speculatists who attempted to combine thedoctrines of Oriental mysticism and asceticism withChristianity, thereby promising the disciples the enjoyment of ahigher spiritual life and a deeper insight into the world ofspirits. Paul argues against such teaching, showing that inChrist Jesus they had all things. He sets forth the majesty ofhis redemption. The mention of the \"new moon\" and \"sabbath days\"(2:16) shows also that there were here Judaizing teachers whosought to draw away the disciples from the simplicity of thegospel.<br><br>Like most of Paul\'s epistles, this consists of two parts, adoctrinal and a practical.<br><br>(1.) The doctrinal part comprises the first two chapters. Hismain theme is developed in chapter 2. He warns them againstbeing drawn away from Him in whom dwelt all the fulness of theGodhead, and who was the head of all spiritual powers. Christwas the head of the body of which they were members; and if theywere truly united to him, what needed they more?<br><br>(2.) The practical part of the epistle (3-4) enforces variousduties naturally flowing from the doctrines expounded. They areexhorted to mind things that are above (3:1-4), to mortify everyevil principle of their nature, and to put on the new man(3:5-14). Many special duties of the Christian life are alsoinsisted upon as the fitting evidence of the Christiancharacter. Tychicus was the bearer of the letter, as he was alsoof that to the Ephesians and to Philemon, and he would tell themof the state of the apostle (4:7-9). After friendly greetings(10-14), he bids them interchange this letter with that he hadsent to the neighbouring church of Laodicea. He then closes thisbrief but striking epistle with his usual autograph salutation.There is a remarkable resemblance between this epistle and thatto the Ephesians (q.v.). The genuineness of this epistle has notbeen called in question.<br><br>'),
(868, 'Colour', 'The subject of colours holds an important place in theScriptures.<br><br>White occurs as the translation of various Hebrew words. It isapplied to milk (Gen. 49:12), manna (Ex. 16:31), snow (Isa.1:18), horses (Zech. 1:8), raiment (Eccl. 9:8). Another Hebrewword so rendered is applied to marble (Esther 1:6), and acognate word to the lily (Cant. 2:16). A different term, meaning\"dazzling,\" is applied to the countenance (Cant. 5:10).<br><br>This colour was an emblem of purity and innocence (Mark 16:5;John 20:12; Rev. 19:8, 14), of joy (Eccl. 9:8), and also ofvictory (Zech. 6:3; Rev. 6:2). The hangings of the tabernaclecourt (Ex. 27:9; 38:9), the coats, mitres, bonnets, and breechesof the priests (Ex. 39:27, 28), and the dress of the high prieston the day of Atonement (Lev. 16:4, 32), were white.<br><br>Black, applied to the hair (Lev. 13:31; Cant. 5:11), thecomplexion (Cant. 1:5), and to horses (Zech. 6:2, 6). The wordrendered \"brown\" in Gen. 30:32 (R.V., \"black\") means properly\"scorched\", i.e., the colour produced by the influence of thesun\'s rays. \"Black\" in Job 30:30 means dirty, blackened bysorrow and disease. The word is applied to a mourner\'s robes(Jer. 8:21; 14:2), to a clouded sky (1 Kings 18:45), to night(Micah 3:6; Jer. 4:28), and to a brook rendered turbid by meltedsnow (Job 6:16). It is used as symbolical of evil in Zech. 6:2,6 and Rev. 6:5.

The colouring matter in each separate shell-fishamounted to only a single drop, and hence the great value ofthis dye. Robes of this colour were worn by kings (Judg. 8:26)and high officers (Esther 8:15). They were also worn by thewealthy and luxurious (Jer. 10:9; Ezek. 27:7; Luke 16:19; Rev.17:4).

This colour was also procured from a species ofshell-fish, the chelzon of the Hebrews, and the Helix ianthinaof modern naturalists. The tint was emblematic of the sky, thedeep dark hue of the Eastern sky. This colour was used in thesame way as purple. The ribbon and fringe of the Hebrew dresswere of this colour (Num. 15:38). The loops of the curtains (Ex.26:4), the lace of the high priest\'s breastplate, the robe ofthe ephod, and the lace on his mitre, were blue (Ex. 28:28, 31,37).<br><br>Scarlet, or Crimson. In Isa. 1:18 a Hebrew word is used whichdenotes the worm or grub whence this dye was procured. In Gen.38:28, 30, the word so rendered means \"to shine,\" and expressesthe brilliancy of the colour. The small parasitic insects fromwhich this dye was obtained somewhat resembled the cochinealwhich is found in Eastern countries. It is called by naturalistsCoccus ilics. The dye was procured from the female grub alone.The only natural object to which this colour is applied inScripture is the lips, which are likened to a scarlet thread(Cant. 4:3). Scarlet robes were worn by the rich and luxurious(2 Sam. 1:24; Prov. 31:21; Jer. 4:30. Rev. 17:4). It was alsothe hue of the warrior\'s dress (Nah. 2:3; Isa. 9:5). ThePhoenicians excelled in the art of dyeing this colour (2 Chr.2:7).<br><br>These four colours--white, purple, blue, and scarlet--were usedin the textures of the tabernacle curtains (Ex. 26:1, 31, 36),and also in the high priest\'s ephod, girdle, and breastplate(Ex. 28:5, 6, 8, 15). Scarlet thread is mentioned in connectionwith the rites of cleansing the leper (Lev. 14:4, 6, 51) and ofburning the red heifer (Num. 19:6). It was a crimson thread thatRahab was to bind on her window as a sign that she was to besaved alive (Josh. 2:18; 6:25) when the city of Jericho wastaken.<br><br>Vermilion, the red sulphuret of mercury, or cinnabar; a colourused for drawing the figures of idols on the walls of temples(Ezek. 23:14), or for decorating the walls and beams of houses(Jer. 22:14).<br><br>'),

They werewritten by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The firsttables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from themount (32:19), being thrown by him on the ground. At the commandof God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wroteon them \"the words that were on the first tables\" (34:1). Thesetables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant (Deut.10:5; 1 Kings 8:9). Their subsequent history is unknown.

The Jews make the \"Preface\" one of the commandments,and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics andLutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth intotwo. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutheransand Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first tableand seven to the second.

The \"cords of a man\"(Hos. 11:4) means that men employ, in inducing each other,methods such as are suitable to men, and not \"cords\" such asoxen are led by. Isaiah (5:18) says, \"Woe unto them that drawiniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cartrope.\" This verse is thus given in the Chaldee paraphrase: \"Woeto those who begin to sin by little and little, drawing sin bycords of vanity: these sins grow and increase till they arestrong and are like a cart rope.\" This may be the true meaning.The wicked at first draw sin with a slender cord; but by-and-bytheir sins increase, and they are drawn after them by a cartrope. Henderson in his commentary says: \"The meaning is that thepersons described were not satisfied with ordinary modes ofprovoking the Deity, and the consequent ordinary approach of hisvengeance, but, as it were, yoked themselves in the harness ofiniquity, and, putting forth all their strength, drew down uponthemselves, with accelerated speed, the load of punishment whichtheir sins deserved.\"<br><br>'),

(900, 'Corinth', 'A Grecian city, on the isthmus which joins the Peloponnesus tothe mainland of Greece. It is about 48 miles west of Athens. Theancient city was destroyed by the Romans (B.C. 146), and thatmentioned in the New Testament was quite a new city, having beenrebuilt about a century afterwards and peopled by a colony offreedmen from Rome. It became under the Romans the seat ofgovernment for Southern Greece or Achaia (Acts 18:12-16). It wasnoted for its wealth, and for the luxurious and immoral andvicious habits of the people. It had a large mixed population ofRomans, Greeks, and Jews. When Paul first visited the city (A.D.51 or 52), Gallio, the brother of Seneca, was proconsul. HerePaul resided for eighteen months (18:1-18). Here he first becameaquainted with Aquila and Priscilla, and soon after hisdeparture Apollos came to it from Ephesus. After an interval hevisited it a second time, and remained for three months (20:3).During this second visit his Epistle to the Romans was written(probably A.D. 55). Although there were many Jewish converts atCorinth, yet the Gentile element prevailed in the church there.<br><br>Some have argued from 2 Cor. 12:14; 13:1, that Paul visitedCorinth a third time (i.e., that on some unrecorded occasion hevisited the city between what are usually called the first andsecond visits). But the passages referred to only indicatePaul\'s intention to visit Corinth (comp. 1 Cor. 16:5, where theGreek present tense denotes an intention), an intention whichwas in some way frustrated.

Paul thereuponwrote this letter, for the purpose of checking the factiousspirit and correcting the erroneous opinions that had sprung upamong them, and remedying the many abuses and disorderlypractices that prevailed. Titus and a brother whose name is notgiven were probably the bearers of the letter (2 Cor. 2:13; 8:6,16-18).<br><br>The epistle may be divided into four parts:<br><br>(1.) The apostle deals with the subject of the lamentabledivisions and party strifes that had arisen among them (1 Cor.1-4).<br><br>(2.) He next treats of certain cases of immorality that hadbecome notorious among them. They had apparently set at noughtthe very first principles of morality (5; 6).<br><br>(3.) In the third part he discusses various questions ofdoctrine and of Christian ethics in reply to certaincommunications they had made to him. He especially rectifiescertain flagrant abuses regarding the celebration of the Lord\'ssupper (7-14).<br><br>(4.)

It gives a vivid picture of the earlychurch...It entirely dissipates the dream that the apostolicchurch was in an exceptional condition of holiness of life orpurity of doctrine.\" The apostle in this epistle unfolds andapplies great principles fitted to guide the church of all agesin dealing with the same and kindred evils in whatever form theymay appear.<br><br>This is one of the epistles the authenticity of which has neverbeen called in question by critics of any school, so many and soconclusive are the evidences of its Pauline origin.<br><br>The subscription to this epistle states erroneously in theAuthorized Version that it was written at Philippi.

He thenleft Troas and proceeded to Macedonia; and at Philippi, where hetarried, he was soon joined by Titus (2 Cor. 7:6, 7), whobrought him good news from Corinth, and also by Timothy.

(916, 'Covenant', 'A contract or agreement between two parties.

In entering into a convenant, Jehovah wassolemnly called on to witness the transaction (Gen. 31:50), andhence it was called a \"covenant of the Lord\" (1 Sam. 20:8). Themarriage compact is called \"the covenant of God\" (Prov. 2:17),because the marriage was made in God\'s name. Wicked men arespoken of as acting as if they had made a \"covenant with death\"not to destroy them, or with hell not to devour them (Isa.28:15, 18).<br><br>(2.) The word is used with reference to God\'s revelation ofhimself in the way of promise or of favour to men. Thus God\'spromise to Noah after the Flood is called a covenant (Gen. 9;Jer. 33:20, \"my covenant\"). We have an account of God\'scovernant with Abraham (Gen. 17, comp. Lev. 26:42), of thecovenant of the priesthood (Num. 25:12, 13; Deut. 33:9; Neh.13:29), and of the covenant of Sinai (Ex. 34:27, 28; Lev.26:15), which was afterwards renewed at different times in thehistory of Israel (Deut. 29; Josh. 1:24; 2 Chr. 15; 23; 29; 34;Ezra 10; Neh. 9). In conformity with human custom, God\'scovenant is said to be confirmed with an oath (Deut. 4:31; Ps.89:3), and to be accompanied by a sign (Gen. 9; 17). Hence thecovenant is called God\'s \"counsel,\" \"oath,\" \"promise\" (Ps. 89:3,4; 105:8-11; Heb. 6:13-20; Luke 1:68-75).

The condition was perfect obedience to the law, thetest in this case being abstaining from eating the fruit of the\"tree of knowledge,\" etc. (4.) The penalty was death (Gen. 2:16,17).<br><br>This covenant is also called a covenant of nature, as made withman in his natural or unfallen state; a covenant of life,because \"life\" was the promise attached to obedience; and alegal covenant, because it demanded perfect obedience to thelaw.<br><br>The \"tree of life\" was the outward sign and seal of that lifewhich was promised in the covenant, and hence it is usuallycalled the seal of that covenant.<br><br>This covenant is abrogated under the gospel, inasmuch as Christhas fulfilled all its conditions in behalf of his people, andnow offers salvation on the condition of faith.

(928, 'Cross', 'In the New Testament the instrument of crucifixion, and henceused for the crucifixion of Christ itself (Eph. 2:16; Heb. 12:2;1 Cor. 1:17, 18; Gal. 5:11; 6:12, 14; Phil. 3:18). The word isalso used to denote any severe affliction or trial (Matt. 10:38;16:24; Mark 8:34; 10:21).<br><br>The forms in which the cross is represented are these:<br><br>1. The crux simplex (I), a \"single piece without transom.\"<br><br>2. The crux decussata (X), or St. Andrew\'s cross.<br><br>3. The crux commissa (T), or St. Anthony\'s cross.<br><br>4. The crux immissa (t), or Latin cross, which was the kind ofcross on which our Saviour died. Above our Lord\'s head, on theprojecting beam, was placed the \"title.\" (See [134]CRUCIFIXION.)<br><br>After the conversion, so-called, of Constantine the Great (B.C.313), the cross first came into use as an emblem ofChristianity. He pretended at a critical moment that he saw aflaming cross in the heavens bearing the inscription, \"In hocsigno vinces\", i.e., By this sign thou shalt conquer, and thaton the following night Christ himself appeared and ordered himto take for his standard the sign of this cross. In this form anew standard, called the Labarum, was accordingly made, andborne by the Roman armies. It remained the standard of the Romanarmy till the downfall of the Western empire. It bore theembroidered monogram of Christ, i.e., the first two Greekletters of his name, X and P (chi and rho), with the Alpha andOmega. (See [135]A.)<br><br>'),
(929, 'Crown', '(1.) Denotes the plate of gold in the front of the high priest\'smitre (Ex. 29:6; 39:30). The same Hebrew word so rendered(ne\'zer) denotes the diadem worn by Saul in battle (2 Sam.1:10), and also that which was used at the coronation of Joash(2 Kings 11:12).<br><br>(2.) The more general name in Hebrew for a crown is \'atarah,meaning a \"circlet.\" This is used of crowns and head ornamentsof divers kinds, including royal crowns. Such was the crowntaken from the king of Ammon by David (2 Sam. 12:30). The crownworn by the Assyrian kings was a high mitre, sometimes adornedwith flowers. There are sculptures also representing the crownsworn by the early Egyptian and Persian kings. Sometimes a diademsurrounded the royal head-dress of two or three fillets. Thisprobably signified that the wearer had dominion over two orthree countries. In Rev. 12:3; 13:1, we read of \"many crowns,\" atoken of extended dominion.<br><br>(3.) The ancient Persian crown (Esther 1:11; 2:17; 6:8) wascalled kether; i.e., \"a chaplet,\" a high cap or tiara. Crownswere worn sometimes to represent honour and power (Ezek. 23:42).They were worn at marriages (Cant. 3:11; Isa. 61:10,\"ornaments;\" R.V., \"a garland\"), and at feasts and publicfestivals.<br><br>The crown was among the Romans and Greeks a symbol of victoryand reward. The crown or wreath worn by the victors in theOlympic games was made of leaves of the wild olive; in thePythian games, of laurel; in the Nemean games, of parsley; andin the Isthmian games, of the pine. The Romans bestowed the\"civic crown\" on him who saved the life of a citizen. It wasmade of the leaves of the oak. In opposition to all these fadingcrowns the apostles speak of the incorruptible crown, the crownof life (James 1:12; Rev. 2:10) \"that fadeth not away\" (1 Pet.5:4, Gr. amarantinos; comp. 1:4). Probably the word \"amaranth\"was applied to flowers we call \"everlasting,\" the \"immortalamaranth.\"<br><br>'),
(930, 'Crown of thorns', 'Our Lord was crowned with a, in mockery by the Romans (Matt.27:29). The object of Pilate\'s guard in doing this was probablyto insult, and not specially to inflict pain. There is nothingto show that the shrub thus used was, as has been supposed, thespina Christi, which could have been easily woven into a wreath.It was probably the thorny nabk, which grew abundantly roundabout Jerusalem, and whose flexible, pliant, and round branchescould easily be platted into the form of a crown. (See[136]THORN, 3.)<br><br>'),
(931, 'Crucifixion', 'A common mode of punishment among heathen nations in earlytimes. It is not certain whether it was known among the ancientJews; probably it was not. The modes of capital punishmentaccording to the Mosaic law were, by the sword (Ex. 21),strangling, fire (Lev. 20), and stoning (Deut. 21).<br><br>This was regarded as the most horrible form of death, and to aJew it would acquire greater horror from the curse in Deut.21:23.<br><br>This punishment began by subjecting the sufferer to scourging.In the case of our Lord, however, his scourging was ratherbefore the sentence was passed upon him, and was inflicted byPilate for the purpose, probably, of exciting pity and procuringhis escape from further punishment (Luke 23:22; John 19:1).<br><br>The condemned one carried his own cross to the place ofexecution, which was outside the city, in some conspicuous placeset apart for the purpose. Before the nailing to the cross tookplace, a medicated cup of vinegar mixed with gall and myrrh (thesopor) was given, for the purpose of deadening the pangs of thesufferer. Our Lord refused this cup, that his senses might beclear (Matt. 27:34). The spongeful of vinegar, sour wine, posca,the common drink of the Roman soldiers, which was put on ahyssop stalk and offered to our Lord in contemptuous pity (Matt.27:48; Luke 23:36), he tasted to allay the agonies of his thirst(John 19:29). The accounts given of the crucifixion of our Lordare in entire agreement with the customs and practices of theRoman in such cases. He was crucified between two \"malefactors\"(Isa. 53:12; Luke 23:32), and was watched by a party of foursoldiers (John 19:23; Matt. 27:36, 54), with their centurion.The \"breaking of the legs\" of the malefactors was intended tohasten death, and put them out of misery (John 19:31); but theunusual rapidity of our Lord\'s death (19:33) was due to hisprevious sufferings and his great mental anguish. The omissionof the breaking of his legs was the fulfilment of a type (Ex.12:46). He literally died of a broken heart, a ruptured heart,and hence the flowing of blood and water from the wound made bythe soldier\'s spear (John 19:34). Our Lord uttered sevenmemorable words from the cross, namely, (1) Luke 23:34; (2)23:43; (3) John 19:26; (4) Matt. 27:46, Mark 15:34; (5) John19:28; (6) 19:30; (7) Luke 23:46.<br><br>'),

In 1 Kings14:3 the word there so rendered means properly a bottle, as inJer. 19:1, 10, or pitcher. In 2 Kings 2:20, a platter or flatmetal saucer is intended. The Hebrew word here used istranslated \"dish\" in 21:13; \"pans,\" in 2 Chr. 35:13; and\"bosom,\" in Prov. 19:24; 26:15 (R.V., \"dish\").<br><br>'),
(933, 'Crystal', '(Ezek. 1:22, with the epithet \"terrible,\" as dazzling thespectators with its brightness). The word occurs in Rev. 4:6;21:11; 22:1.

(934, 'Cubit', 'Heb. ammah; i.e., \"mother of the arm,\" the fore-arm, is a wordderived from the Latin cubitus, the lower arm. It is difficultto determine the exact length of this measure, from theuncertainty whether it included the entire length from the elbowto the tip of the longest finger, or only from the elbow to theroot of the hand at the wrist. The probability is that thelonger was the original cubit. The common computation as to thelength of the cubit makes it 20.24 inches for the ordinarycubit, and 21.888 inches for the sacred one. This is the same asthe Egyptian measurements.<br><br>A rod or staff the measure of a cubit is called in Judg. 3:16gomed, which literally means a \"cut,\" something \"cut off.\" TheLXX. and Vulgate render it \"span.\"<br><br>'),
(935, 'Cuckoo', '(Heb. shahaph), from a root meaning \"to be lean; slender.\" Thisbird is mentioned only in Lev. 11:16 and Deut. 14:15 (R.V.,\"seamew\"). Some have interpreted the Hebrew word by \"petrel\" or\"shearwater\" (Puffinus cinereus), which is found on the coast ofSyria; others think it denotes the \"sea-gull\" or \"seamew.\" Thecommon cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) feeds on reptiles and largeinsects. It is found in Asia and Africa as well as in Europe. Itonly passes the winter in Palestine. The Arabs suppose it toutter the cry Yakub_, and hence they call it _tir el-Yakub;i.e., \"Jacob\'s bird.\"<br><br>'),
(936, 'Cucumbers', '(Heb. plur. kishshuim; i.e., \"hard,\" \"difficult\" of digestion,only in Num. 11:5). This vegetable is extensively cultivated inthe East at the present day, as it appears to have been inearlier times among the Hebrews. It belongs to the gourd familyof plants. In the East its cooling pulp and juice are mostrefreshing. \"We need not altogether wonder that the Israelites,wearily marching through the arid solitudes of the Sinaiticpeninsula, thought more of the cucumbers and watermelons ofwhich they had had no lack in Egypt, rather than of the cruelbondage which was the price of these luxuries.\" Groser\'sScripture Natural History.<br><br>Isaiah speaks of a \"lodge\" (1:8; Heb. sukkah), i.e., a shed oredifice more solid than a booth, for the protection throughoutthe season from spring to autumn of the watchers in a \"garden ofcucumbers.\"<br><br>'),

(938, 'Cup', 'A wine-cup (Gen. 40:11, 21), various forms of which are found onAssyrian and Egyptian monuments. All Solomon\'s drinking vesselswere of gold (1 Kings 10: 21). The cups mentioned in the NewTestament were made after Roman and Greek models, and weresometimes of gold (Rev. 17:4).<br><br>The art of divining by means of a cup was practiced in Egypt(Gen. 44:2-17), and in the East generally.<br><br>The \"cup of salvation\" (Ps. 116:13) is the cup of thanksgivingfor the great salvation. The \"cup of consolation\" (Jer. 16:7)refers to the custom of friends sending viands and wine toconsole relatives in mourning (Prov. 31:6). In 1 Cor. 10:16, the\"cup of blessing\" is contrasted with the \"cup of devils\" (1 Cor.10:21). The sacramental cup is the \"cup of blessing,\" because ofblessing pronounced over it (Matt. 26:27; Luke 22:17). The\"portion of the cup\" (Ps. 11:6; 16:5) denotes one\'s condition oflife, prosperous or adverse. A \"cup\" is also a type of sensualallurement (Jer. 51:7; Prov. 23:31; Rev. 17:4). We read also ofthe \"cup of astonishment,\" the \"cup of trembling,\" and the \"cupof God\'s wrath\" (Ps. 75:8; Isa. 51:17; Jer. 25:15; Lam. 4:21;Ezek. 23:32; Rev. 16:19; comp.

The cup-bearer of the king of Egypt ismentioned in connection with Joseph\'s history (Gen. 40:1-21;41:9). Rabshakeh (q.v.) was cup-bearer in the Assyrian court (2Kings 18:17). Nehemiah filled this office to the king of Persia(Neh. 1:11). We read also of Solomon\'s cup-bearers (1 Kings10:5; 2 Chr. 9:4).<br><br>'),
(940, 'Curious arts', '(Acts 19:19), magical arts; jugglery practised by the Ephesianconjurers. Ephesus was noted for its wizard and the \"Ephesianspells;\" i.e., charms or scraps of parchment written over withcertain formula, which were worn as a safeguard against allmanner of evils. The more important and powerful of these charmswere written out in books which circulated among the exorcists,and were sold at a great price.<br><br>'),
(941, 'Curse', 'Denounced by God against the serpent (Gen. 3:14), and againstCain (4:11). These divine maledictions carried their effect withthem. Prophetical curses were sometimes pronounced by holy men(Gen. 9:25; 49:7; Deut. 27:15; Josh. 6:26). Such curses are notthe consequence of passion or revenge, they are predictions.<br><br>No one on pain of death shall curse father or mother (Ex.21:17), nor the prince of his people (22:28), nor the deaf (Lev.19:14). Cursing God or blaspheming was punishable by death (Lev.24:10-16). The words \"curse God and die\" (R.V., \"renounce Godand die\"), used by Job\'s wife (Job 2:9), have been variouslyinterpreted. Perhaps they simply mean that as nothing but deathwas expected, God would by this cursing at once interpose anddestroy Job, and so put an end to his sufferings.<br><br>'),

(943, 'Cush', 'Black. (1.) A son, probably the eldest, of Ham, and the fatherof Nimrod (Gen. 10:8; 1 Chr. 1:10). From him the land of Cushseems to have derived its name. The question of the preciselocality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a littlecontroversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the wholeland of Cush (Gen. 2:13, R.V.). The term Cush is in the OldTestament generally applied to the countries south of theIsraelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt (Ezek. 29:10,A.V. \"Ethiopia,\" Heb. Cush), with which it is generallyassociated (Ps. 68:31; Isa. 18:1; Jer. 46:9, etc.). It standsalso associated with Elam (Isa. 11:11), with Persia (Ezek.38:5), and with the Sabeans (Isa. 45:14). From these facts ithas been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country onthe west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be thecountry still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the LowerTigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusionthat there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called bythe Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; comp. 30:4-6) ofit as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to usas Nubia and Abyssinia (Isa. 18:1; Zeph. 3:10, Heb. Cush). Inancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed Kesh. TheCushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts,stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. Atan early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites\"from Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia,and Persia, to Western India.\" The Hamite races, soon aftertheir arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west.Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving fromWestern Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the PersianGulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in themountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwardsas Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphratesand the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores andislands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to theMediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as thePhoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered theAccadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, andfounded his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, andso forming the Chaldean nation.<br><br>(2.) A Benjamite of this name is mentioned in the title of Ps.7. \"Cush was probably a follower of Saul, the head of his tribe,and had sought the friendship of David for the purpose of\'rewarding evil to him that was at peace with him.\'\"<br><br>'),

These publicans were tempted to exact morefrom the people than was lawful, and were, in consequence oftheir extortions, objects of great hatred. The Pharisees wouldhave no intercourse with them (Matt. 5:46, 47; 9:10, 11).<br><br>A tax or tribute (q.v.) of half a shekel was annually paid byevery adult Jew for the temple.

They increased in number andinfluence; and we are thus prepared for the frequent referencesto them in connection with the early history of Christianity.Simon, who bore our Lord\'s cross, was a native of this place(Matt. 27:32; Mark 15:21). Jews from Cyrene were in Jerusalem atPentecost (Acts 2:10); and Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue atJerusalem (6:9).

Cyrus was a great military leader, bent onuniversal conquest. Babylon fell before his army (B.C. 538) onthe night of Belshazzar\'s feast (Dan. 5:30), and then theancient dominion of Assyria was also added to his empire (cf.,\"Go up, O Elam\", Isa. 21:2).<br><br>Hitherto the great kings of the earth had only oppressed theJews.

At this time only (B.C. 536) Cyrus became actualking over Palestine, which became a part of his Babylonianempire. The edict of Cyrus for the rebuilding of Jerusalemmarked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people (2 Chr.36:22, 23; Ezra 1:1-4; 4:3; 5:13-17; 6:3-5).<br><br>This decree was discovered \"at Achmetha [R.V. marg.,\"Ecbatana\"], in the palace that is in the province of the Medes\"(Ezra 6:2).

In B.C. 538 there was a revolt in SouthernBabylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from thenorth. In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated atOpis, and immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to theconqueror. Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Kurdistan, was thensent to Babylon, which surrendered \"without fighting,\" and thedaily services in the temples continued without a break. InOctober, Cyrus himself arrived, and proclaimed a generalamnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to \"all the provinceof Babylon,\" of which he had been made governor.

At the first deportation of the Jews by Nebuchadnezzar(the kingdom of Israel had come to an end nearly a centurybefore), or immediately after his victory over the Egyptians atthe second battle of Carchemish, in the fourth year of the reignof Jehoiakim (B.C. 606), Daniel and other three noble youthswere carried off to Babylon, along with part of the vessels ofthe temple.

He soon became known for his skill in the interpretationof dreams (1:17; 2:14), and rose to the rank of governor of theprovince of Babylon, and became \"chief of the governors\" (Chald.Rab-signin) over all the wise men of Babylon. He made known andalso interpreted Nebuchadnezzar\'s dream; and many yearsafterwards, when he was now an old man, amid the alarm andconsternation of the terrible night of Belshazzar\'s impiousfeast, he was called in at the instance of the queen-mother(perhaps Nitocris, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar) to interpretthe mysterious handwriting on the wall.

The enemies of the Jews lost no timein bringing the matter under the notice of Darius, who causedsearch to be made for the decree of Cyrus (q.v.). It was notfound at Babylon, but at Achmetha (Ezra 6:2); and Dariusforthwith issued a new decree, giving the Jews full liberty toprosecute their work, at the same time requiring the Syriansatrap and his subordinates to give them all needed help.

He mentions that with his own unaided hand he slew alion and also a bear, when they came out against his flock,beating them to death in open conflict with his club (1 Sam.17:34, 35).<br><br>While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus engagedwith his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to Bethlehem,having been guided thither by divine direction (1 Sam. 16:1-13).There he offered up sacrifice, and called the elders of Israeland Jesse\'s family to the sacrificial meal. Among all whoappeared before him he failed to discover the one he sought.David was sent for, and the prophet immediately recognized himas the chosen of God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was nowdeparting from the ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. Heaccordingly, in anticipation, poured on his head the anointingoil. David went back again to his shepherd life, but \"the Spiritof the Lord came upon David from that day forward,\" and \"theSpirit of the Lord departed from Saul\" (1 Sam. 16:13, 14).<br><br>Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his harpthe troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a strangemelancholy dejection. He played before the king so skilfullythat Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain greataffection for the young shepherd. After this he went home toBethlehem. But he soon again came into prominence. The armies ofthe Philistines and of Israel were in battle array in the valleyof Elah, some 16 miles south-west of Bethlehem; and David wassent by his father with provisions for his three brothers, whowere then fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival inthe camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) wasmade aware of the state of matters when the champion of thePhilistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. Davidtook his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a stone \"outof the brook,\" which struck the giant\'s forehead, so that hefell senseless to the ground. David then ran and slew him, andcut off his head with his own sword (1 Sam. 17). The result wasa great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistinesto the gates of Gath and Ekron.<br><br>David\'s popularity consequent on this heroic exploit awakenedSaul\'s jealousy (1 Sam. 18:6-16), which he showed in variousways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward him, and by variousstratagems sought his death (1 Sam. 18-30). The deep-laid plotsof the enraged king, who could not fail to observe that David\"prospered exceedingly,\" all proved futile, and only endearedthe young hero the more to the people, and very specially toJonathan, Saul\'s son, between whom and David a life-long warmfriendship was formed.<br><br>A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David fled toRamah (1 Sam. 19:12-18) to Samuel, who received him, and hedwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were there underSamuel\'s training. It is supposed by some that the sixth,seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed by him at this time.This place was only 3 miles from the residence of Saul, who soondiscovered whither the fugitive had gone, and triedineffectually to bring him back. Jonathan made a fruitlesseffort to bring his father to a better state of mind towardDavid (1 Sam. 20), who, being made aware of the fact, saw nohope of safety but in flight to a distance. We accordingly findhim first at Nob (21:1-9) and then at Gath, the chief city ofthe Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit himinto his service, as he expected that he would, and Davidaccordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of Adullam(22:1-4; 1 Chr. 12:8-18). Here in a short time 400 men gatheredaround him and acknowledged him as their leader. It was at thistime that David, amid the harassment and perils of his position,cried, \"Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the wellof Bethlehem;\" when three of his heroes broke through the linesof the Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed(2 Sam. 23:13-17), but which he would not drink.<br><br>In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize David,Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire priestly familyat Nob, \"persons who wore a linen ephod\", to the number ofeighty-five persons, who were put to death by Doeg the Edomite.The sad tidings of the massacre were brought to David byAbiathar, a son of Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Comp.Ps. 52.<br><br>Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, washarassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it (1Sam. 23:1-14); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to thestrongholds in the \"hill country\" of Judah. Comp. Ps. 31. Whileencamped there, in the forest in the district of Ziph, he wasvisited by Jonathan, who spoke to him words of encouragement(23:16-18). The two now parted never to meet again. Saulcontinued his pursuit of David, who narrowly escaped from him atthis time, and fled to the crags and ravines of Engedi, on thewestern shore of the Dead Sea (1 Sam. 23:29). Here Saul, whostill pursued him with his army, narrowly escaped, through thegenerous forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by whatDavid had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him, andDavid betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men, hemaintained himself by contributions gathered from the district.Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal and his wifeAbigail (1 Sam. 25), whom David married after Nabal\'s death.<br><br>Saul again went forth (1 Sam. 26) in pursuit of David, who hadhid himself \"in the hill Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon,\" inthe wilderness of Ziph, and was a second time spared through hisforbearance. He returned home, professing shame and penitencefor the way in which he had treated David, and predicting hiselevation to the throne.<br><br>Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of movingfrom place to place through fear of Saul, David once more soughtrefuge among the Philistines (1 Sam. 27). He was welcomed by theking, who assigned him Ziklag as his residence. Here David livedamong his followers for some time as an independent chiefengaged in frequent war with the Amalekites and other tribes onthe south of Judah.<br><br>Achish summoned David with his men to join his army againstSaul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious ofDavid\'s loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to Ziklag, whichhe found to his dismay may had been pillaged and burnt duringhis brief absence. David pursued after the raiders, theAmalekites, and completely routed them. On his return to Ziklagtidings reached him of Saul\'s death (2 Sam. 1). An Amalekitebrought Saul\'s crown and bracelet and laid them at his feet.David and his men rent their clothes and mourned for Saul, whohad been defeated in battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed abeautiful elegy, the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a\"lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son\" (2 Sam.1:18-27). It bore the title of \"The Bow,\" and was to be taughtto the children, that the memory of Saul and Jonathan might bepreserved among them. \"Behold, it is written in the book ofJasher\" (q.v.).<br><br>David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for Hebronunder divine direction (2 Sam. 2:1-4). There they were cordiallywelcomed, and he was at once anointed as king. He was now aboutthirty years of age.<br><br>But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner tookIsh-bosheth, Saul\'s only remaining son, over the Jordan toMahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a civil warin Israel. The first encounter between the two opposing armies,led on the one side by Abner, and on the other by Joab, tookplace at the pool of Gibeon. It resulted in the defeat of Abner.Other encounters, however, between Israel and Judah followed (2Sam. 3:1, 5), but still success was on the side of David. Forthe space of seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron.Abner now sided with David, and sought to promote hisadvancement; but was treacherously put to death by Joab inrevenge for his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon(3:22-39). This was greatly to David\'s regret. He mourned forthe death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was alsotreacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth; andthere being now no rival, David was anointed king over allIsrael (4:1-12).<br><br>David king over all Israel (2 Sam. 5:1-5; 1 Chr. 11:1-3). Theelders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered allegianceto David in name of all the people, among whom the greatestenthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king over all Israel, andsought out a new seat of government, more suitable than Hebron,as the capital of his empire. At this time there was a Jebusitefortress, \"the stronghold\", on the hill of Zion, called alsoJebus. This David took from the Jebusites, and made it Israel\'scapital, and established here his residence, and afterwardsbuilt for himself a palace by the aid of Tyrian tradesmen. ThePhilistines, who had for some time observed a kind of truce, nowmade war against David; but were defeated in battle at a placeafterwards called, in remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim.Again they invaded the land, and were a second time routed byhim. He thus delivered Israel from their enemies.<br><br>David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to hisnew capital (2 Sam. 6). It was in the house of Abinadab atKirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it had beenfor many years, from the time when the Philistines had sent ithome (1 Sam. 6; 7). In consequence of the death of Uzzah (for itwas a divine ordinance that only the Levites should handle theark, Num. 4), who had put forth his hand to steady the ark whenthe cart in which it was being conveyed shook by reason of theroughness of the road, David stayed the procession, and conveyedthe ark into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath.After three months David brought the ark from the house ofObed-edom up to Jerusalem. Comp. Ps. 24. Here it was placed in anew tent or tabernacle which David erected for the purpose.About seventy years had passed since it had stood in thetabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at Gibeah, atwhich Zadok ministered. David now (1 Chr. 16) carefully set inorder all the ritual of divine worship at Jerusalem, along withAbiathar the high priest. A new religious era began. The serviceof praise was for the first time introduced into public worship.Zion became henceforth \"God\'s holy hill.\"<br><br>David\'s wars. David now entered on a series of conquests whichgreatly extended and strengthened his kingdom (2 Sam. 8). In afew years the whole territory from the Euphrates to the river ofEgypt, and from Gaza on the west to Thapsacus on the east, wasunder his sway (2 Sam. 8:3-13; 10).<br><br>David\'s fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. Heruled over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with thespoils of many lands. But in the midst of all this success hefell, and his character became stained with the sin of adultery(2 Sam. 11:2-27). It has been noted as characteristic of theBible that while his military triumphs are recorded in a fewverses, the sad story of his fall is given in detail, a storyfull of warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in theattempt to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder.Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the Gibborim,the corps of heros (23:39), was, by his order, \"set in the frontof the hottest battle\" at the siege of Rabbah, in order that hemight be put to death. Nathan the prophet (2 Sam. 7:1-17;12:1-23) was sent by God to bring home his crimes to theconscience of the guilty monarch. He became a true penitent. Hebitterly bewailed his sins before God. The thirty-second andfifty-first Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, andhis spiritual recovery.<br><br>Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah\'s death. Her first-bornson died, according to the word of the prophet. She gave birthto a second son, whom David called Solomon, and who ultimatelysucceeded him on the throne (2 Sam. 12:24, 25).<br><br>Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars, Davidformed the idea of building a temple for the ark of God. This hewas not permitted to carry into execution, because he had been aman of war. God, however, sent Nathan to him with a graciousmessage (2 Sam. 7:1-16). On receiving it he went into thesanctuary, the tent where the ark was, and sat before the Lord,and poured out his heart in words of devout thanksgiving(18-29). The building of the temple was reserved for his sonSolomon, who would be a man of peace (1 Chr. 22:9; 28:3).<br><br>A cloudy evening. Hitherto David\'s carrer had been one of greatprosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days came. Hiseldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel, wasguilty of a great and shameful crime (2 Sam. 13). This was thebeginning of the disasters of his later years. After two yearsAbsalom terribly avenged the crime against Tamar, and put Amnonto death. This brought sore trouble to David\'s heart. Absalom,afraid of the consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyondJordan, where he remained for three years, when he was broughtback through the intrigue of Joab (2 Sam. 14).<br><br>After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three years\'famine (2 Sam. 21:1-14). This was soon after followed by apestilence, brought upon the land as a punishment for David\'ssinful pride in numbering the people (2 Sam. 24), in which nofewer than 70,000 perished in the space of three days.<br><br>Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was sadlylowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a strong popularsentiment against the taking of the census, and the outburst ofthe plague in connection with it deepened the feeling ofjealously that had begun to manifest itself among some of thetribes against David. Absalom, taking full advantage of thisstate of things, gradually gained over the people, and at lengthopenly rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne.Ahithophel was Absalom\'s chief counsellor. The revolt began inHebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there proclaimed king.David was now in imminent danger, and he left Jerusalem (2 Sam.15:13-20), and once more became a fugitive. It was a momentousday in Israel. The incidents of it are recorded with a fulnessof detail greater than of any other day in Old Testamenthistory. David fled with his followers to Mahanarm, on the eastof Jordan. An unnatural civil war broke out. After a few weeksthe rival armies were mustered and organized. They met inhostile array at the wood of Ephraim (2 Sam. 18:1-8). Absalom\'sarmy was defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab(9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son filledthe heart of David with the most poignant grief. He \"went up tothe chamber over the gate, and wept\" (33), giving utterance tothe heart-broken cry, \"Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom,my son, my son!\" Peace was now restored, and David returned toJerusalem and resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappydispute arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel(19:41-43). Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men ofIsrael. He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put todeath, and so the revolt came to an end.<br><br>The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom andthat of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of David\'s lifepassed away. During those years he seems to have beenprincipally engaged in accumulating treasures of every kind forthe great temple at Jerusalem, which it was reserved to hissuccessor to build (1 Chr. 22; 28; 29), a house which was to be\"exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout allcountries\" (22:5). The exciting and laborious life he had spent,and the dangers and trials through which he had passed, had lefthim an enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent thathis life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracybroke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favouredAdonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the \"Fuller\'s spring,\"in the valley of Kidron, to proclaim him king; but Nathanhastened on a decision on the part of David in favour ofSolomon, and so the aim of Adonijah\'s party failed. Solomon wasbrought to Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on hisfather\'s throne (1 Kings 1:11-53). David\'s last words are agrand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith in God, and hisjoyful confidence in his gracious covenant promises (2 Sam.23:1-7).<br><br>After a reign of forty years and six months (2 Sam. 5:5; 1 Chr.3:4) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy years, \"andwas buried in the city of David.\" His tomb is still pointed outon Mount Zion.<br><br>Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David was atype of the Messiah (1 Sam. 16:13). The book of Psalms commonlybears the title of the \"Psalms of David,\" from the circumstancethat he was the largest contributor (about eighty psalms) to thecollection. (See [146]PSALMS.)<br><br>\"The greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He had livedin harmony with both the priesthood and the prophets; a suresign that the spirit of his government had been throughly loyalto the higher aims of the theocracy. The nation had not beenoppressed by him, but had been left in the free enjoyment of itsancient liberties. As far as his power went he had striven toact justly to all (2 Sam. 8:15). His weak indulgence to hissons, and his own great sin besides, had been bitterly atoned,and were forgotten at his death in the remembrance of hislong-tried worth. He had reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalemand seven and a half at Hebron (2 Sam. 5:5). Israel at hisaccession had reached the lowest point of national depression;its new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory assailed bythe Philistines. But he had left it an imperial power, withdominions like those of Egypt or Assyria. The sceptre of Solomonwas already, before his father\'s death, owned from theMediterranean to the Euphrates, and from the Orontes to the RedSea.\", Geikie\'s Hours etc., iii.<br><br>'),

This jealousy early appeared in the Christiancommunity. It was alleged by the Hellenists that their widowswere overlooked in the daily distribution of alms. This spiritmust be checked. The apostles accordingly advised the disciplesto look out for seven men of good report, full of the HolyGhost, and men of practical wisdom, who should take entirecharge of this distribution, leaving them free to devotethemselves entirely to the spiritual functions of their office(Acts 6:1-6). This was accordingly done. Seven men were chosen,who appear from their names to have been Hellenists. The name\"deacon\" is nowhere applied to them in the New Testament; theyare simply called \"the seven\" (21:8). Their office was at firstsecular, but it afterwards became also spiritual; for amongother qualifications they must also be \"apt to teach\" (1 Tim. 3:8-12).

The commanding wisdom of his enactments, the dignity ofhis position as the founder of the nation and the first ofprophets, enforce his utterances. But he touches our deepestemotions by the human tenderness that breathes in all his words.Standing on the verge of life, he speaks as a father giving hisparting counsels to those he loves; willing to depart and bewith God he has served so well, but fondly lengthening out hislast farewell to the dear ones of earth.

The book professes to have beenwritten by Moses (1:1; 29:1; 31:1, 9-11, etc.), and wasobviously intended to be accepted as his work. (3.) Theincontrovertible testimony of our Lord and his apostles (Matt.19:7, 8; Mark 10:3, 4; John 5:46, 47; Acts 3:22; 7:37; Rom.10:19) establishes the same conclusion. (4.)

In the morning the fog thus created restslike a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills,which raise their heads above it like so many islands. Atsunrise, however, the scene speedily changes. By the kindlinglight the mist is transformed into vast snow-white clouds, whichpresently break into separate masses and rise up themountain-sides, to disappear in the blue above, dissipated bythe increasing heat.

It is the symbol of a multitude (2 Sam. 17:12;Ps. 110:3); and from its refreshing influence it is an emblem ofbrotherly love and harmony (Ps. 133:3), and of rich spiritualblessings (Hos. 14:5).<br><br>'),

Alexander the Great placed a large number of Jews inAlexandria, which he had founded, and conferred on them equalrights with the Egyptians. Ptolemy Philadelphus, it is said,caused the Jewish Scriptures to be translated into Greek (thework began B.C. 284), for the use of the Alexandrian Jews.

Three kinds ofdivination are mentioned in Ezek. 21:21, by arrows, consultingwith images (the teraphim), and by examining the entrails ofanimals sacrificed. The practice of this art seems to have beenencouraged in ancient Egypt. Diviners also abounded among theaborigines of Canaan and the Philistines (Isa. 2:6; 1 Sam. 28).At a later period multitudes of magicians poured from Chaldeaand Arabia into the land of Israel, and pursued theiroccupations (Isa. 8:19; 2 Kings 21:6; 2 Chr. 33:6). Thissuperstition widely spread, and in the time of the apostlesthere were \"vagabond Jews, exorcists\" (Acts 19:13), and men likeSimon Magus (Acts 8:9), Bar-jesus (13:6, 8), and other jugglersand impostors (19:19; 2 Tim. 3:13). Every species and degree ofthis superstition was strictly forbidden by the law of Moses(Ex. 22:18; Lev. 19:26, 31; 20:27; Deut. 18:10, 11).<br><br>But beyond these various forms of superstition, there areinstances of divination on record in the Scriptures by which Godwas pleased to make known his will.<br><br>(1.) There was divination by lot, by which, when resorted to inmatters of moment, and with solemnity, God intimated his will(Josh. 7:13). The land of Canaan was divided by lot (Num. 26:55,56); Achan\'s guilt was detected (Josh. 7:16-19), Saul waselected king (1 Sam. 10:20, 21), and Matthias chosen to theapostleship, by the solem lot (Acts 1:26).

It seems that it was not uncommonfor the Jews at that time to dissolve the union on very slightpretences (Matt. 5:31, 32; 19:1-9; Mark 10:2-12; Luke 16:18).These precepts given by Christ regulate the law of divorce inthe Christian Church.<br><br>'),

Othersignificant dreams are also recorded, such as those of Abimelech(Gen. 20:3-7), Pharaoh\'s chief butler and baker (40:5), Pharaoh(41:1-8), the Midianites (Judg. 7:13), Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 2:1;4:10, 18), the wise men from the east (Matt. 2:12), and Pilate\'swife (27:19).<br><br>To Joseph \"the Lord appeared in a dream,\" and gave himinstructions regarding the infant Jesus (Matt. 1:20; 2:12, 13,19).

(1076, 'Dress', '(1.) Materials used. The earliest and simplest an apron offig-leaves sewed together (Gen. 3:7); then skins of animals(3:21). Elijah\'s dress was probably the skin of a sheep (2 Kings1:8). The Hebrews were early acquainted with the art of weavinghair into cloth (Ex. 26:7; 35:6), which formed the sackcloth ofmourners. This was the material of John the Baptist\'s robe(Matt. 3:4). Wool was also woven into garments (Lev. 13:47;Deut. 22:11; Ezek. 34:3; Job 31:20; Prov. 27:26). The Israelitesprobably learned the art of weaving linen when they were inEgypt (1 Chr. 4:21). Fine linen was used in the vestments of thehigh priest (Ex. 28:5), as well as by the rich (Gen. 41:42;Prov. 31:22; Luke 16:19). The use of mixed material, as wool andflax, was forbidden (Lev. 19:19; Deut. 22:11).<br><br>(2.) Colour. The prevailing colour was the natural white of thematerial used, which was sometimes rendered purer by thefuller\'s art (Ps. 104:1, 2; Isa. 63:3; Mark 9:3). The Hebrewswere acquainted with the art of dyeing (Gen. 37:3, 23). Variousmodes of ornamentation were adopted in the process of weaving(Ex. 28:6; 26:1, 31; 35:25), and by needle-work (Judg. 5:30; Ps.45:13). Dyed robes were imported from foreign countries,particularly from Phoenicia (Zeph. 1:8). Purple and scarletrobes were the marks of the wealthy (Luke 16:19; 2 Sam. 1:24).<br><br>(3.) Form. The robes of men and women were not very muchdifferent in form from each other.<br><br>(a) The \"coat\" (kethoneth), of wool, cotton, or linen, was wornby both sexes. It was a closely-fitting garment, resembling inuse and form our shirt (John 19:23). It was kept close to thebody by a girdle (John 21:7). A person wearing this \"coat\" alonewas described as naked (1 Sam. 19:24; Isa. 20:2; 2 Kings 6:30;John 21:7); deprived of it he would be absolutely naked.<br><br>(b) A linen cloth or wrapper (sadin) of fine linen, usedsomewhat as a night-shirt (Mark 14:51). It is mentioned in Judg.14:12, 13, and rendered there \"sheets.\"<br><br>(c) An upper tunic (meil), longer than the \"coat\" (1 Sam. 2:19;24:4; 28:14). In 1 Sam. 28:14 it is the mantle in which Samuelwas enveloped; in 1 Sam. 24:4 it is the \"robe\" under which Saulslept. The disciples were forbidden to wear two \"coats\" (Matt.10:10; Luke 9:3).<br><br>(d) The usual outer garment consisted of a piece of woollencloth like a Scotch plaid, either wrapped round the body orthrown over the shoulders like a shawl, with the ends hangingdown in front, or it might be thrown over the head so as toconceal the face (2 Sam. 15:30; Esther 6:12). It was confined tothe waist by a girdle, and the fold formed by the overlapping ofthe robe served as a pocket (2 Kings 4:39; Ps. 79:12; Hag. 2:12;Prov. 17:23; 21:14).<br><br>Female dress. The \"coat\" was common to both sexes (Cant. 5:3).But peculiar to females were (1) the \"veil\" or \"wimple,\" a kindof shawl (Ruth 3:15; rendered \"mantle,\" R.V., Isa. 3:22); (2)the \"mantle,\" also a species of shawl (Isa. 3:22); (3) a \"veil,\"probably a light summer dress (Gen. 24:65); (4) a \"stomacher,\" aholiday dress (Isa. 3:24). The outer garment terminated in anample fringe or border, which concealed the feet (Isa. 47:2;Jer. 13:22).<br><br>The dress of the Persians is described in Dan. 3:21.<br><br>The reference to the art of sewing are few, inasmuch as thegarments generally came forth from the loom ready for beingworn, and all that was required in the making of clothesdevolved on the women of a family (Prov. 31:22; Acts 9:39).<br><br>Extravagance in dress is referred to in Jer. 4:30; Ezek. 16:10;Zeph. 1:8 (R.V., \"foreign apparel\"); 1 Tim. 2:9; 1 Pet. 3:3.Rending the robes was expressive of grief (Gen. 37:29, 34), fear(1 Kings 21:27), indignation (2 Kings 5:7), or despair (Judg.11:35; Esther 4:1).<br><br>Shaking the garments, or shaking the dust from off them, was asign of renunciation (Acts 18:6); wrapping them round the head,of awe (1 Kings 19:13) or grief (2 Sam. 15:30; casting them off,of excitement (Acts 22:23); laying hold of them, of supplication(1 Sam. 15:27). In the case of travelling, the outer garmentswere girded up (1 Kings 18:46). They were thrown aside also whenthey would impede action (Mark 10:50; John 13:4; Acts 7:58).<br><br>'),
(1077, 'Drink', 'The drinks of the Hebrews were water, wine, \"strong drink,\" andvinegar. Their drinking vessels were the cup, goblet or \"basin,\"the \"cruse\" or pitcher, and the saucer.<br><br>To drink water by measure (Ezek. 4:11), and to buy water todrink (Lam. 5:4), denote great scarcity.

One-fourth of anhin of wine was required for one lamb, one-third for a ram, andone-half for a bullock (Num. 15:5; 28:7, 14). \"Drink offeringsof blood\" (Ps. 16:4) is used in allusion to the heathen practiceof mingling the blood of animals sacrificed with wine or water,and pouring out the mixture in the worship of the gods, and theidea conveyed is that the psalmist would not partake of theabominations of the heathen.<br><br>'),

They paused on their wings, waiting tillthey had made their flight, and then took a second and largergyration, always rising toward the sun, and enlarging theircircle of flight so as to make a gradually ascending spiral.

When the brook dried up God sent himto the widow of Zarephath, a city of Zidon, from whose scantystore he was supported for the space of two years. During thisperiod the widow\'s son died, and was restored to life by Elijah(1 Kings 17: 2-24).<br><br>During all these two years a famine prevailed in the land. Atthe close of this period of retirement and of preparation forhis work (comp. Gal. 1:17, 18) Elijah met Obadiah, one of Ahab\'sofficers, whom he had sent out to seek for pasturage for thecattle, and bade him go and tell his master that Elijah wasthere. The king came and met Elijah, and reproached him as thetroubler of Israel. It was then proposed that sacrifices shouldbe publicly offered, for the purpose of determining whether Baalor Jehovah were the true God. This was done on Carmel, with theresult that the people fell on their faces, crying, \"The Lord,he is the God.\" Thus was accomplished the great work of Elijah\'sministry. The prophets of Baal were then put to death by theorder of Elijah. Not one of them escaped. Then immediatelyfollowed rain, according to the word of Elijah, and in answer tohis prayer (James 5:18).<br><br>Jezebel, enraged at the fate that had befallen her priests ofBaal, threatened to put Elijah to death (1 Kings 19:1-13). Hetherefore fled in alarm to Beersheba, and thence went alone aday\'s journey into the wilderness, and sat down in despondencyunder a juniper tree. As he slept an angel touched him, and saidunto him, \"Arise and eat; because the journey is too great forthee.\" He arose and found a cake and a cruse of water. Havingpartaken of the provision thus miraculously supplied, he wentforward on his solitary way for forty days and forty nights toHoreb, the mount of God, where he took up his abode in a cave.Here the Lord appeared unto him and said, \"What dost thou here,Elijah?\" In answer to his despondent words God manifests to himhis glory, and then directs him to return to Damascus and anointHazael king over Syria, and Jehu king over Israel, and Elisha tobe prophet in his room (1 Kings 19:13-21; comp. 2 Kings 8:7-15;9:1-10).<br><br>Some six years after this he warned Ahab and Jezebel of theviolent deaths they would die (1 Kings 21:19-24; 22:38). Healso, four years afterwards, warned Ahaziah (q.v.), who hadsucceeded his father Ahab, of his approaching death (2 Kings1:1-16). (See [178]NABOTH.) During these intervals he probablywithdrew to some quiet retirement, no one knew where. Hisinterview with Ahaziah\'s messengers on the way to Ekron, and theaccount of the destruction of his captains with their fifties,suggest the idea that he may have been in retirement at thistime on Mount Carmel.<br><br>The time now drew near when he was to be taken up into heaven (2Kings 2:1-12). He had a presentiment of what was awaiting him.He went down to Gilgal, where was a school of the prophets, andwhere his successor Elisha, whom he had anointed some yearsbefore, resided. Elisha was solemnized by the thought of hismaster\'s leaving him, and refused to be parted from him. \"Theytwo went on,\" and came to Bethel and Jericho, and crossed theJordan, the waters of which were \"divided hither and thither\"when smitten with Elijah\'s mantle. Arrived at the borders ofGilead, which Elijah had left many years before, it \"came topass as they still went on and talked\" they were suddenlyseparated by a chariot and horses of fire; and \"Elijah went upby a whirlwind into heaven, \"Elisha receiving his mantle, whichfell from him as he ascended.<br><br>No one of the old prophets is so frequently referred to in theNew Testament. The priests and Levites said to the Baptist (John1:25), \"Why baptizest thou, if thou be not that Christ, norElias?\" Paul (Rom. 11:2) refers to an incident in his history toillustrate his argument that God had not cast away his people.James (5:17) finds in him an illustration of the power ofprayer. (See also Luke 4:25; 9:54.) He was a type of John theBaptist in the sternness and power of his reproofs (Luke 9:8).He was the Elijah that \"must first come\" (Matt. 11:11, 14), theforerunner of our Lord announced by Malachi. Even outwardly theBaptist corresponded so closely to the earlier prophet that hemight be styled a second Elijah. In him we see \"the sameconnection with a wild and wilderness country; the same longretirement in the desert; the same sudden, startling entrance onhis work (1 Kings 17:1; Luke 3:2); even the same dress, a hairygarment, and a leathern girdle about the loins (2 Kings 1:8;Matt. 3:4).\"<br><br>How deep the impression was which Elijah made \"on the mind ofthe nation may be judged from the fixed belief, which rested onthe words of Malachi (4:5, 6), which many centuries afterprevailed that he would again appear for the relief andrestoration of the country. Each remarkable person as he arriveson the scene, be his habits and characteristics what they may,the stern John equally with his gentle Successor, is proclaimedto be Elijah (Matt. 11:13, 14; 16:14; 17:10; Mark 9:11; 15:35;Luke 9:7, 8; John 1:21). His appearance in glory on the mount oftransfiguration does not seem to have startled the disciples.They were sore afraid,\' but not apparently surprised.\"<br><br>(2.) The Elijah spoken of in 2 Chr. 21:12-15 is by some supposedto be a different person from the foregoing. He lived in thetime of Jehoram, to whom he sent a letter of warning (comp. 1Chr. 28:19; Jer. 36), and acted as a prophet in Judah; while theTishbite was a prophet of the northern kingdom. But there doesnot seem any necessity for concluding that the writer of thisletter was some other Elijah than the Tishbite. It may besupposed either that Elijah anticipated the character ofJehoram, and so wrote the warning message, which was preservedin the schools of the prophets till Jehoram ascended the throneafter the Tishbite\'s translation, or that the translation didnot actually take place till after the accession of Jehoram tothe throne (2 Chr. 21:12; 2 Kings 8:16). The events of 2 Kings 2may not be recorded in chronological order, and thus there maybe room for the opinion that Elijah was still alive in thebeginning of Jehoram\'s reign.<br><br>'),

These wordshe spoke to Moses and Aaron \"seem to gleam through the tears ofthe humbled king, as he lamented his son snatched from him by sosudden a death, and tremble with a sense of the helplessnesswhich his proud soul at last felt when the avenging hand of Godhad visited even his palace.\"<br><br>The terror-stricken Egyptians now urged the instant departure ofthe Hebrews. In the midst of the Passover feast, before the dawnof the 15th day of the month Abib (our April nearly), which wasto be to them henceforth the beginning of the year, as it wasthe commencement of a new epoch in their history, every family,with all that appertained to it, was ready for the march, whichinstantly began under the leadership of the heads of tribes withtheir various sub-divisions. They moved onward, increasing asthey went forward from all the districts of Goshen, over thewhole of which they were scattered, to the common centre. Threeor four days perhaps elapsed before the whole body of the peoplewere assembled at Rameses, and ready to set out under theirleader Moses (Ex. 12:37; Num. 33:3). This city was at that timethe residence of the Egyptian court, and here the interviewsbetween Moses and Pharaoh had taken place.<br><br>From Rameses they journeyed to Succoth (Ex. 12:37), identifiedwith Tel-el-Maskhuta, about 12 miles west of Ismailia. (See[201]PITHOM.) Their third station was Etham (q.v.), 13:20, \"inthe edge of the wilderness,\" and was probably a little to thewest of the modern town of Ismailia, on the Suez Canal. Herethey were commanded \"to turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth,between Migdol and the sea\", i.e., to change their route fromeast to due south. The Lord now assumed the direction of theirmarch in the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night. Theywere then led along the west shore of the Red Sea till they cameto an extensive camping-ground \"before Pi-hahiroth,\" about 40miles from Etham. This distance from Etham may have taken threedays to traverse, for the number of camping-places by no meansindicates the number of days spent on the journey: e.g., it tookfully a month to travel from Rameses to the wilderness of Sin(Ex. 16:1), yet reference is made to only six camping-placesduring all that time. The exact spot of their encampment beforethey crossed the Red Sea cannot be determined. It was probablysomewhere near the present site of Suez.<br><br>Under the direction of God the children of Israel went \"forward\"from the camp \"before Pi-hahiroth,\" and the sea opened a pathwayfor them, so that they crossed to the farther shore in safety.The Egyptian host pursued after them, and, attempting to followthrough the sea, were overwhelmed in its returning waters, andthus the whole military force of the Egyptians perished. They\"sank as lead in the mighty waters\" (Ex. 15:1-9; comp. Ps.77:16-19).<br><br>Having reached the eastern shore of the sea, perhaps a littleway to the north of Ayun Musa (\"the springs of Moses\"), therethey encamped and rested probably for a day. Here Miriam and theother women sang the triumphal song recorded in Ex. 15:1-21.<br><br>From Ayun Musa they went on for three days through a part of thebarren \"wilderness of Shur\" (22), called also the \"wilderness ofEtham\" (Num. 33:8; comp. Ex. 13:20), without finding water. Onthe last of these days they came to Marah (q.v.), where the\"bitter\" water was by a miracle made drinkable.<br><br>Their next camping-place was Elim (q.v.), where were twelvesprings of water and a grove of \"threescore and ten\" palm trees(Ex. 15:27).<br><br>After a time the children of Israel \"took their journey fromElim,\" and encamped by the Red Sea (Num. 33:10), and thenceremoved to the \"wilderness of Sin\" (to be distinguished from thewilderness of Zin, 20:1), where they again encamped. Here,probably the modern el-Markha, the supply of bread they hadbrought with them out of Egypt failed. They began to \"murmur\"for want of bread. God \"heard their murmurings\" and gave themquails and manna, \"bread from heaven\" (Ex. 16:4-36). Mosesdirected that an omer of manna should be put aside and preservedas a perpetual memorial of God\'s goodness. They now turnedinland, and after three encampments came to the rich and fertilevalley of Rephidim, in the Wady Feiran. Here they found nowater, and again murmured against Moses. Directed by God, Mosesprocured a miraculous supply of water from the \"rock in Horeb,\"one of the hills of the Sinai group (17:1-7); and shortlyafterwards the children of Israel here fought their first battlewith the Amalekites, whom they smote with the edge of the sword.<br><br>From the eastern extremity of the Wady Feiran the line of marchnow probably led through the Wady esh-Sheikh and the Wady Solaf,meeting in the Wady er-Rahah, \"the enclosed plain in front ofthe magnificient cliffs of Ras Sufsafeh.\" Here they encamped formore than a year (Num. 1:1; 10:11) before Sinai (q.v.).<br><br>The different encampments of the children of Israel, from thetime of their leaving Egypt till they reached the Promised Land,are mentioned in Ex. 12:37-19; Num. 10-21; 33; Deut. 1, 2, 10.<br><br>It is worthy of notice that there are unmistakable evidencesthat the Egyptians had a tradition of a great exodus from theircountry, which could be none other than the exodus of theHebrews.<br><br>'),

The finalcompletion of the canon may have been, and probably was, thework of a later generation; but Ezra seems to have put it muchinto the shape in which it is still found in the Hebrew Bible.When it is added that the complete organization of the synagoguedates from this period, it will be seen that the age wasemphatically one of Biblical study\" (The Psalms: their History,etc.).<br><br>For about fourteen years, i.e., till B.C. 445, we have no recordof what went on in Jerusalem after Ezra had set in order theecclesiastical and civil affairs of the nation.

On the appointed daythe whole population assembled, and the law was read aloud tothem by Ezra and his assistants (Neh. 8:3). The remarkable sceneis described in detail. There was a great religious awakening.For successive days they held solemn assemblies, confessingtheir sins and offering up solemn sacrifices. They kept also thefeast of Tabernacles with great solemnity and joyous enthusiasm,and then renewed their national covenant to be the Lord\'s.Abuses were rectified, and arrangements for the temple servicecompleted, and now nothing remained but the dedication of thewalls of the city (Neh. 12).<br><br>'),

(1302, 'Faith', 'Faith is in general the persuasion of the mind that a certainstatement is true (Phil. 1:27; 2 Thess. 2:13). Its primary ideais trust. A thing is true, and therefore worthy of trust. Itadmits of many degrees up to full assurance of faith, inaccordance with the evidence on which it rests.<br><br>Faith is the result of teaching (Rom. 10:14-17). Knowledge is anessential element in all faith, and is sometimes spoken of as anequivalent to faith (John 10:38; 1 John 2:3). Yet the two aredistinguished in this respect, that faith includes in it assent,which is an act of the will in addition to the act of theunderstanding. Assent to the truth is of the essence of faith,and the ultimate ground on which our assent to any revealedtruth rests is the veracity of God.<br><br>Historical faith is the apprehension of and assent to certainstatements which are regarded as mere facts of history.<br><br>Temporary faith is that state of mind which is awakened in men(e.g., Felix) by the exhibition of the truth and by theinfluence of religious sympathy, or by what is sometimes styledthe common operation of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Saving faith is so called because it has eternal lifeinseparably connected with it. It cannot be better defined thanin the words of the Assembly\'s Shorter Catechism: \"Faith inJesus Christ is a saving grace, whereby we receive and rest uponhim alone for salvation, as he is offered to us in the gospel.\"<br><br>The object of saving faith is the whole revealed Word of God.Faith accepts and believes it as the very truth most sure. Butthe special act of faith which unites to Christ has as itsobject the person and the work of the Lord Jesus Christ (John7:38; Acts 16:31). This is the specific act of faith by which asinner is justified before God (Rom. 3:22, 25; Gal. 2:16; Phil.3:9; John 3:16-36; Acts 10:43; 16:31). In this act of faith thebeliever appropriates and rests on Christ alone as Mediator inall his offices.<br><br>This assent to or belief in the truth received upon the divinetestimony has always associated with it a deep sense of sin, adistinct view of Christ, a consenting will, and a loving heart,together with a reliance on, a trusting in, or resting inChrist. It is that state of mind in which a poor sinner,conscious of his sin, flees from his guilty self to Christ hisSaviour, and rolls over the burden of all his sins on him. Itconsists chiefly, not in the assent given to the testimony ofGod in his Word, but in embracing with fiducial reliance andtrust the one and only Saviour whom God reveals. This trust andreliance is of the essence of faith. By faith the believerdirectly and immediately appropriates Christ as his own. Faithin its direct act makes Christ ours. It is not a work which Godgraciously accepts instead of perfect obedience, but is only thehand by which we take hold of the person and work of ourRedeemer as the only ground of our salvation.<br><br>Saving faith is a moral act, as it proceeds from a renewed will,and a renewed will is necessary to believing assent to the truthof God (1 Cor. 2:14; 2 Cor. 4:4). Faith, therefore, has its seatin the moral part of our nature fully as much as in theintellectual. The mind must first be enlightened by divineteaching (John 6:44; Acts 13:48; 2 Cor. 4:6; Eph. 1:17, 18)before it can discern the things of the Spirit.<br><br>Faith is necessary to our salvation (Mark 16:16), not becausethere is any merit in it, but simply because it is the sinner\'staking the place assigned him by God, his falling in with whatGod is doing.<br><br>The warrant or ground of faith is the divine testimony, not thereasonableness of what God says, but the simple fact that hesays it. Faith rests immediately on, \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Butin order to this faith the veracity, sincerity, and truth of Godmust be owned and appreciated, together with hisunchangeableness. God\'s word encourages and emboldens the sinnerpersonally to transact with Christ as God\'s gift, to close withhim, embrace him, give himself to Christ, and take Christ ashis.

Thathistory is to be literally interpreted. It records facts whichunderlie the whole system of revealed truth. It is referred toby our Lord and his apostles not only as being true, but asfurnishing the ground of all God\'s subsequent dispensations anddealings with the children of men. The record of Adam\'stemptation and fall must be taken as a true historical account,if we are to understand the Bible at all as a revelation ofGod\'s purpose of mercy.<br><br>The effects of this first sin upon our first parents themselveswere (1) \"shame, a sense of degradation and pollution; (2) dreadof the displeasure of God, or a sense of guilt, and theconsequent desire to hide from his presence. These effects wereunavoidable. They prove the loss not only of innocence but oforiginal righteousness, and, with it, of the favour andfellowship of God. The state therefore to which Adam was reducedby his disobedience, so far as his subjective condition isconcerned, was analogous to that of the fallen angels. He wasentirely and absolutely ruined\" (Hodge\'s Theology).<br><br>But the unbelief and disobedience of our first parents broughtnot only on themselves this misery and ruin, it entailed alsothe same sad consequences on all their descendants.

Hence, also, all his descendants inherit a corrupt nature.In all by nature there is an inherent and prevailing tendency tosin.

Thetestimony of the Scriptures to the same effect is most abundant(Rom. 1; 2; 3:1-19, etc.).<br><br>(3.) This innate depravity is total: we are by nature \"dead intrespasses and sins,\" and must be \"born again\" before we canenter into the kingdom (John 3:7, etc.).<br><br>(4.)

They surely throwsome light on that great question, the origin of evil. God hasthought fit to allow evil to exist in order that he may have aplatform for showing his mercy, grace, and compassion. If manhad never fallen there would have been no opportunity of showingdivine mercy. But by permitting evil, mysterious as it seems,God\'s works of grace, mercy, and wisdom in saving sinners havebeen wonderfully manifested to all his creatures. The redeemingof the church of elect sinners is the means of showing toprincipalities and powers the manifold wisdom of God\' (Eph.3:10).

It is called \"fallow\" from its pale-red or yellowcolour. Some interpreters, however, regard the name asdesignating the bubale, Antelope bubale, the \"wild cow\" of NorthAfrica, which is about the size of a stag, like the hartebeestof South Africa. A species of deer has been found at MountCarmel which is called yahmur by the Arabs. It is said to besimilar to the European roebuck.<br><br>'),

Land wasallowed to lie fallow that it might become more fruitful; butwhen in this condition, it soon became overgrown with thorns andweeds. The cultivator of the soil was careful to \"break up\" hisfallow ground, i.e., to clear the field of weeds, before sowingseed in it.

Such a person was called by the Hebrews an \'ob, whichproperly means a leathern bottle; for sorcerers were regarded asvessels containing the inspiring demon. This Hebrew word wasequivalent to the pytho of the Greeks, and was used to denoteboth the person and the spirit which possessed him (Lev. 20:27;1 Sam. 28:8; comp. Acts 16:16).

By the enactment of Moses, the Hebrewspaid a tithe of the produce to Jehovah, which was assigned tothe priesthood. Military service when required was also to berendered by every Hebrew at his own expense. The occuptaion of ahusbandman was held in high honour (1 Sam. 11:5-7; 1 Kings19:19; 2 Chr. 26:10).

Yet when the Lord acceptedits challenge and drew near, it proved to be but as the others,without fruit as they; for indeed, as the evangelist observes,the time of figs had not yet arrived. Its fault, if one may usethe word, lay in its pretensions, in its making a show to runbefore the rest when it did not so indeed\" (Trench, Miracles).<br><br>The fig-tree of Palestine (Ficus carica) produces two andsometimes three crops of figs in a year, (1) the bikkurah, or\"early-ripe fig\" (Micah 7:1; Isa. 28:4; Hos. 9:10, R.V.), whichis ripe about the end of June, dropping off as soon as it isripe (Nah. 3:12); (2) the kermus, or \"summer fig,\" then beginsto be formed, and is ripe about August; and (3) the pag (plural\"green figs,\" Cant. 2:13; Gr. olynthos, Rev. 6:13, \"the untimelyfig\"), or \"winter fig,\" which ripens in sheltered spots inspring.<br><br>'),

But on Sabbath nofire for any domestic purpose was to be kindled (Ex. 35:3; Num.15:32-36).<br><br>(3.) Punishment of death by fire was inflicted on such as wereguilty of certain forms of unchastity and incest (Lev. 20:14;21:9). The burning of captives in war was not unknown among theJews (2 Sam. 12:31; Jer. 29:22). The bodies of infamous personswho were executed were also sometimes burned (Josh. 7:25; 2Kings 23:16).<br><br>(4.) In war, fire was used in the destruction of cities, asJericho (Josh. 6:24), Ai (8:19), Hazor (11:11), Laish (Judg.18:27), etc. The war-chariots of the Canaanites were burnt(Josh. 11:6, 9, 13).

These objects ofworship seem to have been of the nature of obelisks, and weresometimes evidently made of wood.<br><br>Torches were sometimes carried by the soldiers in battle (Judg.7:16).<br><br>(5.)

It is plain that itwas used to denote solidity as well as expansion. It formed adivision between the waters above and the waters below (Gen.1:7). The raki\'a supported the upper reservoir (Ps. 148:4). Itwas the support also of the heavenly bodies (Gen. 1:14), and isspoken of as having \"windows\" and \"doors\" (Gen. 7:11; Isa.24:18; Mal. 3:10) through which the rain and snow might descend.<br><br>'),

The Galatians were in their origin a part of thatgreat Celtic migration which invaded Macedonia about B.C. 280.They were invited by the king of Bithynia to cross over intoAsia Minor to assist him in his wars. There they ultimatelysettled, and being strengthened by fresh accessions of the sameclan from Europe, they overran Bithynia, and supportedthemselves by plundering neighbouring countries. They were greatwarriors, and hired themselves out as mercenary soldiers,sometimes fighting on both sides in the great battles of thetimes. They were at length brought under the power of Rome inB.C. 189, and Galatia became a Roman province B.C. 25.<br><br>This province of Galatia, within the limits of which theseCeltic tribes were confined, was the central region of AsiaMinor.<br><br>During his second missionary journey Paul, accompanied by Silasand Timothy (Acts 16:6), visited the \"region of Galatia,\" wherehe was detained by sickness (Gal. 4:13), and had thus the longeropportunity of preaching to them the gospel.

The churches of Galatia were founded by Paulhimself (Acts 16:6; Gal. 1:8; 4:13, 19). They seem to have beencomposed mainly of converts from heathenism (4:8), but partlyalso of Jewish converts, who probably, under the influence ofJudaizing teachers, sought to incorporate the rites of Judaismwith Christianity, and by their active zeal had succeeded ininducing the majority of the churches to adopt their views (1:6;3:1). This epistle was written for the purpose of counteractingthis Judaizing tendency, and of recalling the Galatians to thesimplicity of the gospel, and at the same time also ofvindicating Paul\'s claim to be a divinely-commissioned apostle.<br><br>Time and place of writing. The epistle was probably written verysoon after Paul\'s second visit to Galatia (Acts 18:23). Thereferences of the epistle appear to agree with this conclusion.The visit to Jerusalem, mentioned in Gal. 2:1-10, was identicalwith that of Acts 15, and it is spoken of as a thing of thepast, and consequently the epistle was written subsequently tothe council of Jerusalem. The similarity between this epistleand that to the Romans has led to the conclusion that they wereboth written at the same time, namely, in the winter of A.D.57-8, during Paul\'s stay in Corinth (Acts 20:2, 3). This to theGalatians is written on the urgency of the occasion, tidingshaving reached him of the state of matters; and that to theRomans in a more deliberate and systematic way, in exposition ofthe same great doctrines of the gospel.<br><br>Contents of. The great question discussed is, Was the Jewish lawbinding on Christians? The epistle is designed to prove againstthe Jews that men are justified by faith without the works ofthe law of Moses. After an introductory address (Gal. 1:1-10)the apostle discusses the subjects which had occasioned theepistle. (1) He defends his apostolic authority (1:11-19;2:1-14); (2) shows the evil influence of the Judaizers indestroying the very essence of the gospel (3 and 4); (3) exhortsthe Galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is inJesus, and to abound in the fruits of the Spirit, and in a rightuse of their Christian freedom (5-6:1-10); (4) and thenconcludes with a summary of the topics discussed, and with thebenediction.<br><br>The Epistle to the Galatians and that to the Romans takentogether \"form a complete proof that justification is not to beobtained meritoriously either by works of morality or by ritesand ceremonies, though of divine appointment; but that it is afree gift, proceeding entirely from the mercy of God, to thosewho receive it by faith in Jesus our Lord.\"<br><br>In the conclusion of the epistle (6:11) Paul says, \"Ye see howlarge a letter I have written with mine own hand.\" It is impliedthat this was different from his ordinary usage, which wassimply to write the concluding salutation with his own hand,indicating that the rest of the epistle was written by anotherhand. Regarding this conclusion, Lightfoot, in his Commentary onthe epistle, says: \"At this point the apostle takes the pen fromhis amanuensis, and the concluding paragraph is written with hisown hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in hisname (2 Thess. 2:2; 3:17) it seems to have been his practice toclose with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precautionagainst such forgeries...In the present case he writes a wholeparagraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse,eager, disjointed sentences.

It is represented by themodern el-Jib, to the south-west of Ai, and about 5 1/2 milesnorth-north-west of Jerusalem.<br><br>A deputation of the Gibeonites, with their allies from threeother cities (Josh. 9;17), visited the camp at Gilgal, and byfalse representations induced Joshua to enter into a league withthem, although the Israelites had been specially warned againstany league with the inhabitants of Canaan (Ex. 23:32; 34:12;Num. 33:55; Deut. 7:2). The deception practised on Joshua wasdetected three days later; but the oath rashly sworn \"by JehovahGod of Israel\" was kept, and the lives of the Gibeonites werespared. They were, however, made \"bondmen\" to the sanctuary(Josh. 9:23).<br><br>The most remarkable incident connected with this city was thevictory Joshua gained over the kings of Palestine (Josh.10:16-27). The battle here fought has been regarded as \"one ofthe most important in the history of the world.\" The kings ofsouthern Canaan entered into a confederacy against Gibeon(because it had entered into a league with Joshua) under theleadership of Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, and marched uponGibeon with the view of taking possession of it. The Gibeonitesentreated Joshua to come to their aid with the utmost speed. Hisarmy came suddenly upon that of the Amorite kings as it layencamped before the city. It was completely routed, and onlybroken remnants of their great host found refuge in the fencedcities. The five confederate kings who led the army were takenprisoners, and put to death at Makkedah (q.v.). This eventfulbattle of Beth-horon sealed the fate of all the cities ofSouthern Palestine. Among the Amarna tablets is a letter fromAdoni-zedec (q.v.) to the king of Egypt, written probably atMakkedah after the defeat, showing that the kings contemplatedflight into Egypt.<br><br>This place is again brought into notice as the scene of a battlebetween the army of Ish-bosheth under Abner and that of Davidled by Joab. At the suggestion of Abner, to spare the effusionof blood twelve men on either side were chosen to decide thebattle. The issue was unexpected; for each of the men slew hisfellow, and thus they all perished. The two armies then engagedin battle, in which Abner and his host were routed and put toflight (2 Sam. 2:12-17). This battle led to a virtual trucebetween Judah and Israel, Judah, under David, increasing inpower; and Israel, under Ish-bosheth, continually losing ground.<br><br>Soon after the death of Absalom and David\'s restoration to histhrone his kingdom was visited by a grievous famine, which wasfound to be a punishment for Saul\'s violation (2 Sam. 21:2, 5)of the covenant with the Gibeonites (Josh. 9:3-27). TheGibeonites demanded blood for the wrong that had been done tothem, and accordingly David gave up to them the two sons ofRizpah (q.v.) and the five sons of Michal, and these theGibeonites took and hanged or crucified \"in the hill before theLord\" (2 Sam. 21:9); and there the bodies hung for six months(21:10), and all the while Rizpah watched over the blackeningcorpses and \"suffered neither the birds of the air to rest onthem by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.\" Davidafterwards removed the bones of Saul and Jonathan atJabeshgilead (21:12, 13).<br><br>Here, \"at the great stone,\" Amasa was put to death by Joab (2Sam. 20:5-10). To the altar of burnt-offering which was atGibeon, Joab (1 Kings 2:28-34), who had taken the side ofAdonijah, fled for sanctuary in the beginning of Solomon\'sreign, and was there also slain by the hand of Benaiah.<br><br>Soon after he came to the throne, Solomon paid a visit of stateto Gibeon, there to offer sacrifices (1 Kings 3:4; 2 Chr. 1:3).On this occasion the Lord appeared to him in a memorable dream,recorded in 1 Kings 3:5-15; 2 Chr. 1:7-12. When the temple wasbuilt \"all the men of Israel assembled themselves\" to kingSolomon, and brought up from Gibeon the tabernacle and \"all theholy vessels that were in the tabernacle\" to Jerusalem, wherethey remained till they were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar (2Kings 24:13).<br><br>'),

After the victory gained by Deborah andBarak over Jabin, Israel once more sank into idolatry, and theMidianites (q.v.) and Amalekites, with other \"children of theeast,\" crossed the Jordan each year for seven successive yearsfor the purpose of plundering and desolating the land. Gideonreceived a direct call from God to undertake the task ofdelivering the land from these warlike invaders. He was of thefamily of Abiezer (Josh. 17:2; 1 Chr. 7:18), and of the littletownship of Ophrah (Judg. 6:11). First, with ten of hisservants, he overthrew the altars of Baal and cut down theasherah which was upon it, and then blew the trumpet of alarm,and the people flocked to his standard on the crest of MountGilboa to the number of twenty-two thousand men. These were,however, reduced to only three hundred. These, strangely armedwith torches and pitchers and trumpets, rushed in from threedifferent points on the camp of Midian at midnight, in thevalley to the north of Moreh, with the terrible war-cry, \"Forthe Lord and for Gideon\" (Judg. 7:18, R.V.). Terror-stricken,the Midianites were put into dire confusion, and in the darknessslew one another, so that only fifteen thousand out of the greatarmy of one hundred and twenty thousand escaped alive. Thememory of this great deliverance impressed itself deeply on themind of the nation (1 Sam. 12:11; Ps. 83:11; Isa. 9:4; 10:26;Heb. 11:32). The land had now rest for forty years. Gideon diedin a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of hisfathers. Soon after his death a change came over the people.They again forgot Jehovah, and turned to the worship of Baalim,\"neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal\" (Judg.8:35). Gideon left behind him seventy sons, a feeble, sadlydegenerated race, with one exception, that of Abimelech, whoseems to have had much of the courage and energy of his father,yet of restless and unscrupulous ambition. He gathered aroundhim a band who slaughtered all Gideon\'s sons, except Jotham,upon one stone. (See [237]OPHRAH.)<br><br>'),

In Acts 2:38 the generic worddorea is rendered \"gift.\" It differs from the charisma (1 Cor.12:4) as denoting not miraculous powers but the working of a newspirit in men, and that spirit from God.<br><br>The giving of presents entered largely into the affairs ofcommon life in the East. The nature of the presents was asvarious as were the occasions: food (1 Sam. 9:7; 16:20), sheepand cattle (Gen. 32:13-15), gold (2 Sam. 18:11), jewels (Gen.24:53), furniture, and vessels for eating and drinking (2 Sam.17:28); delicacies, as spices, honey, etc. (1 Kings 10:25; 2Kings 5: 22). The mode of presentation was with as much paradeas possible: the presents were conveyed by the hands of servants(Judg. 3:18), or still better, on the backs of beasts of burden(2 Kings 8:9). The refusal of a present was regarded as a highindignity; and this constituted the aggravated insult noticed inMatt. 22:11, the marriage robe having been offered and refused.<br><br>'),
(1484, 'Gifts, spiritual', '(Gr. charismata), gifts supernaturally bestowed on the earlyChristians, each having his own proper gift or gifts for theedification of the body of Christ.

But as, according to the sacrednarrative, all these rivers of Eden took their origin from thehead-waters of the Euphrates and the Trigris, it is probablethat the Gihon is the ancient Araxes, which, under the modernname of the Arras, discharges itself into the Caspian Sea. Itwas the Asiatic and not the African \"Cush\" which the Gihoncompassed (Gen. 10:7-10). (See [238]EDEN.)<br><br>(2.) The only natural spring of water in or near Jerusalem isthe \"Fountain of the Virgin\" (q.v.), which rises outside thecity walls on the west bank of the Kidron valley. On theoccasion of the approach of the Assyrian army under Sennacherib,Hezekiah, in order to prevent the besiegers from finding water,\"stopped the upper water course of Gihon, and brought itstraight down to the west side of the city of David\" (2 Chr.32:30; 33:14). This \"fountain\" or spring is therefore to beregarded as the \"upper water course of Gihon.\" From this\"fountain\" a tunnel cut through the ridge which forms the southpart of the temple hill conveys the water to the Pool of Siloam,which lies on the opposite side of this ridge at the head of theTyropoeon (\"cheesemakers\'\") valley, or valley of the son ofHinnom, now filled up by rubbish. The length of this tunnel isabout 1,750 feet. In 1880 an inscription was accidentallydiscovered on the wall of the tunnel about nineteen feet fromwhere it opens into the Pool of Siloam. This inscription wasexecuted in all probability by Hezekiah\'s workmen. It brieflynarrates the history of the excavation. It may, however, bepossible that this tunnel was executed in the time of Solomon.If the \"waters of Shiloah that go softly\" (Isa. 8:6) refers tothe gentle stream that still flows through the tunnel into thePool of Siloam, then this excavation must have existed beforethe time of Hezekiah.<br><br>In the upper part of the Tyropoeoan valley there are two poolsstill existing, the first, called Birket el-Mamilla, to the westof the Jaffa gate; the second, to the south of the first, calledBirket es-Sultan.

It was a low barren range of mountains bounding the valleyof Esdraelon (Jezreel) on the east, between it and the Jordanvalley.

The ancient Jewsclassified their sacred books as the Law, the Prophets, and theKethubim, or Writings.

Wigs wereworn by priests and laymen to cover the shaven skull, and falsebeards were common. The great masses of hair seen in theportraits and statues of kings and priests are thus altogetherartificial.<br><br>(2.) A precisely opposite practice, as regards men, prevailedamong the Assyrians. In Assyrian sculptures the hair alwaysappears long, and combed closely down upon the head. The beardalso was allowed to grow to its full length.<br><br>(3.) Among the Greeks the custom in this respect varied atdifferent times, as it did also among the Romans. In the time ofthe apostle, among the Greeks the men wore short hair, whilethat of the women was long (1 Cor. 11:14, 15). Paul reproves theCorinthians for falling in with a style of manners which so farconfounded the distinction of the sexes and was hurtful to goodmorals. (See, however, 1 Tim. 2:9, and 1 Pet. 3:3, as regardswomen.)<br><br>(4.)

Tearing the hair and lettingit go dishevelled were also tokens of grief (Ezra 9:3). \"Cuttingoff the hair\" is a figure of the entire destruction of a people(Isa. 7:20). The Hebrews anointed the hair profusely withfragrant ointments (Ruth 3:3; 2 Sam. 14:2; Ps. 23:5; 45:7,etc.), especially in seasons of rejoicing (Matt. 6:17; Luke7:46).<br><br>'),

They were a separate people (Lev. 20:23;26:14-45; Deut. 28), and the other nations, the Amorites,Hittites, etc., were the goyim, the heathen, with whom the Jewswere forbidden to be associated in any way (Josh. 23:7; 1 Kings11:2). The practice of idolatry was the characteristic of thesenations, and hence the word came to designate idolaters (Ps.106:47; Jer. 46:28; Lam. 1:3; Isa. 36:18), the wicked (Ps. 9:5,15, 17).<br><br>The corresponding Greek word in the New Testament, ethne, hassimilar shades of meaning. In Acts 22:21, Gal. 3:14, it denotesthe people of the earth generally; and in Matt. 6:7, anidolater. In modern usage the word denotes all nations that arestrangers to revealed religion.<br><br>'),
(1704, 'Heaven', '(1.) Definitions. The phrase \"heaven and earth\" is used toindicate the whole universe (Gen. 1:1; Jer. 23:24; Acts 17:24).According to the Jewish notion there were three heavens,<br><br>(a) The firmament, as \"fowls of the heaven\" (Gen. 2:19; 7:3, 23;Ps. 8:8, etc.), \"the eagles of heaven\" (Lam. 4:19), etc.<br><br>(b) The starry heavens (Deut. 17:3; Jer. 8:2; Matt. 24:29).<br><br>(c) \"The heaven of heavens,\" or \"the third heaven\" (Deut. 10:14;1 Kings 8:27; Ps. 115:16; 148:4; 2 Cor. 12:2).<br><br>(2.) Meaning of words in the original,<br><br>(a) The usual Hebrew word for \"heavens\" is shamayim, a pluralform meaning \"heights,\" \"elevations\" (Gen. 1:1; 2:1).<br><br>(b) The Hebrew word marom is also used (Ps. 68:18; 93:4; 102:19,etc.) as equivalent to shamayim, \"high places,\" \"heights.\"<br><br>(c) Heb. galgal, literally a \"wheel,\" is rendered \"heaven\" inPs. 77:18 (R.V., \"whirlwind\").<br><br>(d) Heb. shahak, rendered \"sky\" (Deut. 33:26; Job 37:18; Ps.18:11), plural \"clouds\" (Job 35:5; 36:28; Ps. 68:34, marg.\"heavens\"), means probably the firmament.<br><br>(e) Heb. rakia is closely connected with (d), and is rendered\"firmamentum\" in the Vulgate, whence our \"firmament\" (Gen. 1:6;Deut. 33:26, etc.), regarded as a solid expanse.<br><br>(3.) Metaphorical meaning of term. Isa. 14:13, 14; \"doors ofheaven\" (Ps. 78:23); heaven \"shut\" (1 Kings 8:35); \"opened\"(Ezek. 1:1). (See 1 Chr. 21:16.)<br><br>(4.) Spiritual meaning. The place of the everlasting blessednessof the righteous; the abode of departed spirits.<br><br>(a) Christ calls it his \"Father\'s house\" (John 14:2).<br><br>(b) It is called \"paradise\" (Luke 23:43; 2 Cor. 12:4; Rev. 2:7).<br><br>(c) \"The heavenly Jerusalem\" (Gal. 4: 26; Heb. 12:22; Rev.3:12).<br><br>(d) The \"kingdom of heaven\" (Matt. 25:1; James 2:5).<br><br>(e) The \"eternal kingdom\" (2 Pet. 1:11).<br><br>(f) The \"eternal inheritance\" (1 Pet. 1:4; Heb. 9:15).<br><br>(g) The \"better country\" (Heb. 11:14, 16).<br><br>(h) The blessed are said to \"sit down with Abraham, Isaac, andJacob,\" and to be \"in Abraham\'s bosom\" (Luke 16:22; Matt. 8:11);to \"reign with Christ\" (2 Tim. 2:12); and to enjoy \"rest\" (Heb.4:10, 11).<br><br>In heaven the blessedness of the righteous consists in thepossession of \"life everlasting,\" \"an eternal weight of glory\"(2 Cor. 4:17), an exemption from all sufferings for ever, adeliverance from all evils (2 Cor. 5:1, 2) and from the societyof the wicked (2 Tim. 4:18), bliss without termination, the\"fulness of joy\" for ever (Luke 20:36; 2 Cor. 4:16, 18; 1 Pet.1:4; 5:10; 1 John 3:2). The believer\'s heaven is not only astate of everlasting blessedness, but also a \"place\", a place\"prepared\" for them (John 14:2).<br><br>'),
(1705, 'Heave offering', 'Heb. terumah, (Ex. 29:27) means simply an offering, a present,including all the offerings made by the Israelites as a present.This Hebrew word is frequently employed. Some of the rabbisattach to the word the meaning of elevation, and refer it to theheave offering, which consisted in presenting the offering by amotion up and down, distinguished from the wave offering, whichconsisted in a repeated movement in a horizontal direction, a\"wave offering to the Lord as ruler of earth, a heave offeringto the Lord as ruler of heaven.\" The right shoulder, which fellto the priests in presenting thank offerings, was called theheave shoulder (Lev. 7:34; Num. 6:20).

(1706, 'Heber', 'Passing over. (1.) Son of Beriah and grandson of Asher (Gen.46:17; 1 Chr. 7:31, 32).<br><br>(2.)

A Benjamite (1 Chr. 8:17).<br><br>(5.) A Gadite (5:13). (See [264]EBER.)<br><br>'),
(1707, 'Hebrew', 'A name applied to the Israelites in Scripture only by one who isa foreigner (Gen. 39:14, 17; 41:12, etc.), or by the Israeliteswhen they speak of themselves to foreigners (40:15; Ex. 1:19),or when spoken of an contrasted with other peoples (Gen. 43:32;Ex. 1:3, 7, 15; Deut. 15:12). In the New Testament there is thesame contrast between Hebrews and foreigners (Acts 6:1; Phil.3:5).<br><br>Derivation. (1.) The name is derived, according to some, fromEber (Gen. 10:24), the ancestor of Abraham. The Hebrews are\"sons of Eber\" (10:21).<br><br>(2.) Others trace the name of a Hebrew root-word signifying \"topass over,\" and hence regard it as meaning \"the man who passedover,\" viz., the Euphrates; or to the Hebrew word meaning \"theregion\" or \"country beyond,\" viz., the land of Chaldea. Thislatter view is preferred. It is the more probable origin of thedesignation given to Abraham coming among the Canaanites as aman from beyond the Euphrates (Gen. 14:13).<br><br>(3.) A third derivation of the word has been suggested, viz.,that it is from the Hebrew word \'abhar, \"to pass over,\" whence\'ebher, in the sense of a \"sojourner\" or \"passer through\" asdistinct from a \"settler\" in the land, and thus applies to thecondition of Abraham (Heb. 11:13).<br><br>'),
(1708, 'Hebrew language', 'The language of the Hebrew nation, and that in which the OldTestament is written, with the exception of a few portions inChaldee. In the Old Testament it is only spoken of as \"Jewish\"(2 Kings 18:26, 28; Isa. 36:11, 13; 2 Chr 32:18). This name isfirst used by the Jews in times subsequent to the close of theOld Testament.<br><br>It is one of the class of languages called Semitic, because theywere chiefly spoken among the descendants of Shem.<br><br>When Abraham entered Canaan it is obvious that he found thelanguage of its inhabitants closely allied to his own. Isaiah(19:18) calls it \"the language of Canaan.\" Whether thislanguage, as seen in the earliest books of the Old Testament,was the very dialect which Abraham brought with him into Canaan,or whether it was the common tongue of the Canaanitish nationswhich he only adopted, is uncertain; probably the latter opinionis the correct one. For the thousand years between Moses and theBabylonian exile the Hebrew language underwent little or nomodification. It preserves all through a remarkable uniformityof structure. From the first it appears in its full maturity ofdevelopment. But through intercourse with Damascus, Assyria, andBabylon, from the time of David, and more particularly from theperiod of the Exile, it comes under the influence of the Aramaicidiom, and this is seen in the writings which date from thisperiod. It was never spoken in its purity by the Jews aftertheir return from Babylon. They now spoke Hebrew with a largeadmixture of Aramaic or Chaldee, which latterly became thepredominant element in the national language.<br><br>The Hebrew of the Old Testament has only about six thousandwords, all derived from about five hundred roots. Hence the sameword has sometimes a great variety of meanings. So long as itwas a living language, and for ages after, only the consonantsof the words were written. This also has been a source ofdifficulty in interpreting certain words, for the meaning variesaccording to the vowels which may be supplied. The Hebrew is oneof the oldest languages of which we have any knowledge. It isessentially identical with the Phoenician language. (See MOABITE[265]STONE.) The Semitic languages, to which class the Hebrewand Phoenician belonged, were spoken over a very wide area: inBabylonia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine and Arabia, in all thecountries from the Mediterranean to the borders of Assyria, andfrom the mountains of Armenia to the Indian Ocean. The roundedform of the letters, as seen in the Moabite stone, was probablythat in which the ancient Hebrew was written down to the time ofthe Exile, when the present square or Chaldean form was adopted.<br><br>'),

(1711, 'Hebrews, Epistle to', '(1.) Its canonicity. All the results of critical and historicalresearch to which this epistle has been specially subjectedabundantly vindicate its right to a place in the New Testamentcanon among the other inspired books.<br><br>(2.) Its authorship. A considerable variety of opinions on thissubject has at different times been advanced. Some havemaintained that its author was Silas, Paul\'s companion. Othershave attributed it to Clement of Rome, or Luke, or Barnabas, orsome unknown Alexandrian Christian, or Apollos; but theconclusion which we think is best supported, both from internaland external evidence, is that Paul was its author. There are,no doubt, many difficulties in the way of accepting it asPaul\'s; but we may at least argue with Calvin that there can beno difficulty in the way of \"embracing it without controversy asone of the apostolical epistles.\"<br><br>(3.) Date and place of writing. It was in all probabilitywritten at Rome, near the close of Paul\'s two years\'imprisonment (Heb. 13:19, 24). It was certainly written beforethe destruction of Jerusalem (13:10).<br><br>(4.) To whom addressed. Plainly it was intended for Jewishconverts to the faith of the gospel, probably for the church atJerusalem. The subscription of this epistle is, of course,without authority. In this case it is incorrect, for obviouslyTimothy could not be the bearer of it (13:23).<br><br>(5.) Its design was to show the true end and meaning of theMosaic system, and its symbolical and transient character. Itproves that the Levitical priesthood was a \"shadow\" of that ofChrist, and that the legal sacrifices prefigured the great andall-perfect sacrifice he offered for us. It explains that thegospel was designed, not to modify the law of Moses, but tosupersede and abolish it. Its teaching was fitted, as it wasdesigned, to check that tendency to apostatize from Christianityand to return to Judaism which now showed itself among certainJewish Christians. The supreme authority and the transcendentglory of the gospel are clearly set forth, and in such a way asto strengthen and confirm their allegiance to Christ.<br><br>(6.) It consists of two parts: (a) doctrinal (1-10:18), (b) andpractical (10:19-ch. 13). There are found in it many referencesto portions of the Old Testament. It may be regarded as atreatise supplementary to the Epistles to the Romans andGalatians, and as an inspired commentary on the book ofLeviticus.<br><br>'),
(1712, 'Hebron', 'A community; alliance. (1.) A city in the south end of thevalley of Eshcol, about midway between Jerusalem and Beersheba,from which it is distant about 20 miles in a straight line.

Its earlier name wasKirjath-arba (Gen. 23:2; Josh. 14:15; 15:3). But \"Hebron wouldappear to have been the original name of the city, and it wasnot till after Abraham\'s stay there that it received the nameKirjath-arba, who [i.e., Arba] was not the founder but theconqueror of the city, having led thither the tribe of theAnakim, to which he belonged. It retained this name till it cameinto the possession of Caleb, when the Israelites restored theoriginal name Hebron\" (Keil, Com.). The name of this city doesnot occur in any of the prophets or in the New Testament. It isfound about forty times in the Old. It was the favorite home ofAbraham. Here he pitched his tent under the oaks of Mamre, bywhich name it came afterwards to be known; and here Sarah died,and was buried in the cave of Machpelah (Gen. 23:17-20), whichhe bought from Ephron the Hittite. From this place the patriarchdeparted for Egypt by way of Beersheba (37:14; 46:1). It wastaken by Joshua and given to Caleb (Josh. 10:36, 37; 12:10;14:13). It became a Levitical city and a city of refuge (20:7;21:11). When David became king of Judah this was his royalresidence, and he resided here for seven and a half years (2Sam. 5:5); and here he was anointed as king over all Israel (2Sam. 2:1-4, 11; 1 Kings 2:11).

He lived till the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, and inall likelihood outlived that monarch (who died B.C. 698), andmay have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh.

He was also noted for hisspirituality and for his deep-toned reverence toward \"the holyOne of Israel.\"<br><br>In early youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion ofIsrael by the Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.), 2 Kings 15:19; andagain, twenty years later, when he had already entered on hisoffice, by the invasion of Tiglath-pileser and his career ofconquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused toco-operate with the kings of Israel and Syria in opposition tothe Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated byRezin of Damascus and Pekah of Samaria (2 Kings 16:5; 2 Chr.28:5, 6). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought theaid of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequencewas that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the peoplecarried captive to Assyria (2 Kings 15:29; 16:9; 1 Chr. 5:26).Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly to subdue thekingdom of Israel. Samaria was taken and destroyed (B.C. 722).So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested bythe Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah(B.C. 726), who \"rebelled against the king of Assyria\" (2 Kings18:7), in which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted thepeople to place all their dependence on Jehovah (Isa. 10:24;37:6), entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt (Isa.30:2-4). This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king ofJudah, and at length to invade the land. Sennacherib (B.C. 701)led a powerful army into Palestine. Hezekiah was reduced todespair, and submitted to the Assyrians (2 Kings 18:14-16). Butafter a brief interval war broke out again, and againSennacherib (q.v.) led an army into Palestine, one detachment ofwhich threatened Jerusalem (Isa. 36:2-22; 37:8). Isaiah on thatoccasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians (37:1-7),whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah,which he \"spread before the Lord\" (37:14). The judgement of Godnow fell on the Assyrian host. \"Like Xerxes in Greece,Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster inJudah. He made no more expeditions against either SouthernPalestine or Egypt.\" The remaining years of Hezekiah\'s reignwere peaceful (2 Chr. 32:23, 27-29).

Thus, counting from the fourth yearbefore Uzziah\'s death (B.C. 762) to the last year of Hezekiah(B.C. 698), Isaiah\'s ministry extended over a period ofsixty-four years. He may, however, have survived Hezekiah, andmay have perished in the way indicated above.<br><br>The book, as a whole, has been divided into three main parts:(1.) The first thirty-five chapters, almost wholly prophetic,Israel\'s enemy Assyria, present the Messiah as a mighty Rulerand King. (2.) Four chapters are historical (36-39), relating tothe times of Hezekiah. (3.) Prophetical (40-66), Israel\'s enemyBabylon, describing the Messiah as a suffering victim, meek andlowly.<br><br>The genuineness of the section Isa. 40-66 has been keenlyopposed by able critics. They assert that it must be theproduction of a deutero-Isaiah, who lived toward the close ofthe Babylonian captivity. This theory was originated by Koppe, aGerman writer at the close of the last century. There are otherportions of the book also (e.g., ch. 13; 24-27; and certainverses in ch. 14 and 21) which they attribute to some otherprophet than Isaiah. Thus they say that some five or seven, oreven more, unknown prophets had a hand in the production of thisbook. The considerations which have led to such a result arevarious: (1.) They cannot, as some say, conceive it possiblethat Isaiah, living in B.C. 700, could foretell the appearanceand the exploits of a prince called Cyrus, who would set theJews free from captivity one hundred and seventy years after.(2.) It is alleged that the prophet takes the time of theCaptivity as his standpoint, and speaks of it as then present;and (3) that there is such a difference between the style andlanguage of the closing section (40-66) and those of thepreceding chapters as to necessitate a different authorship, andlead to the conclusion that there were at least two Isaiahs. Buteven granting the fact of a great diversity of style andlanguage, this will not necessitate the conclusion attempted tobe drawn from it. The diversity of subjects treated of and thepeculiarities of the prophet\'s position at the time theprophecies were uttered will sufficiently account for this.<br><br>The arguments in favour of the unity of the book are quiteconclusive. When the LXX. version was made (about B.C. 250) theentire contents of the book were ascribed to Isaiah, the son ofAmoz. It is not called in question, moreover, that in the timeof our Lord the book existed in the form in which we now haveit. Many prophecies in the disputed portions are quoted in theNew Testament as the words of Isaiah (Matt. 3:3; Luke 3:4-6;4:16-41; John 12:38; Acts 8:28; Rom. 10:16-21). Universal andpersistent tradition has ascribed the whole book to one author.<br><br>Besides this, the internal evidence, the similarity in thelanguage and style, in the thoughts and images and rhetoricalornaments, all points to the same conclusion; and its localcolouring and allusions show that it is obviously of Palestinianorigin. The theory therefore of a double authorship of the book,much less of a manifold authorship, cannot be maintained. Thebook, with all the diversity of its contents, is one, and is, webelieve, the production of the great prophet whose name itbears.<br><br>'),

War, with varying success,was carried on between the two kingdoms for about sixty years,till Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with the house ofAhab.<br><br>Extent of the kingdom. In the time of Solomon the area ofPalestine, excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore ofthe Mediterranean, did not much exceed 13,000 square miles. Thekingdom of Israel comprehended about 9,375 square miles. Shechemwas the first capital of this kingdom (1 Kings 12:25),afterwards Tirza (14:17). Samaria was subsequently chosen as thecapital (16:24), and continued to be so till the destruction ofthe kingdom by the Assyrians (2 Kings 17:5). During the siege ofSamaria (which lasted for three years) by the Assyrians,Shalmaneser died and was succeeded by Sargon, who himself thusrecords the capture of that city: \"Samaria I looked at, Icaptured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away\" (2 Kings17:6) into Assyria. Thus after a duration of two hundred andfifty-three years the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end.They were scattered throughout the East. (See [302]CAPTIVITY.)<br><br>\"Judah held its ground against Assyria for yet one hundred andtwenty-three years, and became the rallying-point of thedispersed of every tribe, and eventually gave its name to thewhole race. Those of the people who in the last struggle escapedinto the territories of Judah or other neighbouring countriesnaturally looked to Judah as the head and home of their race.And when Judah itself was carried off to Babylon, many of theexiled Israelites joined them from Assyria, and swelled thatimmense population which made Babylonia a second Palestine.\"<br><br>After the deportation of the ten tribes, the deserted land wascolonized by various eastern tribes, whom the king of Assyriasent thither (Ezra 4:2, 10; 2 Kings 17:24-29).

He was born probably at Lahai-roi, when his fatherwas fifty-nine and Abraham one hundred and fifty-nine years old.Like his father, he was of a quiet and gentle disposition, andwhen he grew up followed the life of a shepherd, while hisbrother Esau became an enterprising hunter. His dealing withEsau, however, showed much mean selfishness and cunning (Gen.25:29-34).<br><br>When Isaac was about 160 years of age, Jacob and his motherconspired to deceive the aged patriarch (Gen. 27), with the viewof procuring the transfer of the birthright to himself. Thebirthright secured to him who possessed it (1) superior rank inhis family (Gen. 49:3); (2) a double portion of the paternalinheritance (Deut. 21:17); (3) the priestly office in the family(Num. 8:17-19); and (4) the promise of the Seed in which allnations of the earth were to be blessed (Gen. 22:18).<br><br>Soon after his acquisition of his father\'s blessing (Gen. 27),Jacob became conscious of his guilt; and afraid of the anger ofEsau, at the suggestion of Rebekah Isaac sent him away to Haran,400 miles or more, to find a wife among his cousins, the familyof Laban, the Syrian (28). There he met with Rachel (29). Labanwould not consent to give him his daughter in marriage till hehad served seven years; but to Jacob these years \"seemed but afew days, for the love he had to her.\" But when the seven yearswere expired, Laban craftily deceived Jacob, and gave him hisdaughter Leah. Other seven years of service had to be completedprobably before he obtained the beloved Rachel. But \"life-longsorrow, disgrace, and trials, in the retributive providence ofGod, followed as a consequence of this double union.\"<br><br>At the close of the fourteen years of service, Jacob desired toreturn to his parents, but at the entreaty of Laban he tarriedyet six years with him, tending his flocks (31:41). He then setout with his family and property \"to go to Isaac his father inthe land of Canaan\" (Gen. 31). Laban was angry when he heardthat Jacob had set out on his journey, and pursued after him,overtaking him in seven days. The meeting was of a painful kind.After much recrimination and reproach directed against Jacob,Laban is at length pacified, and taking an affectionate farewellof his daughters, returns to his home in Padanaram. And now allconnection of the Israelites with Mesopotamia is at an end.<br><br>Soon after parting with Laban he is met by a company of angels,as if to greet him on his return and welcome him back to theLand of Promise (32:1, 2). He called the name of the placeMahanaim, i.e., \"the double camp,\" probably his own camp andthat of the angels. The vision of angels was the counterpart ofthat he had formerly seen at Bethel, when, twenty years before,the weary, solitary traveller, on his way to Padan-aram, saw theangels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose topreached to heaven (28:12).<br><br>He now hears with dismay of the approach of his brother Esauwith a band of 400 men to meet him. In great agony of mind heprepares for the worst. He feels that he must now depend only onGod, and he betakes himself to him in earnest prayer, and sendson before him a munificent present to Esau, \"a present to mylord Esau from thy servant Jacob.\" Jacob\'s family were thentransported across the Jabbok; but he himself remained behind,spending the night in communion with God. While thus engaged,there appeared one in the form of a man who wrestled with him.In this mysterious contest Jacob prevailed, and as a memorial ofit his name was changed to Israel (wrestler with God); and theplace where this occured he called Peniel, \"for\", said he, \"Ihave seen God face to face, and my life is preserved\"(32:25-31).<br><br>After this anxious night, Jacob went on his way, halting,mysteriously weakened by the conflict, but strong in theassurance of the divine favour. Esau came forth and met him; buthis spirit of revenge was appeased, and the brothers met asfriends, and during the remainder of their lives they maintainedfriendly relations. After a brief sojourn at Succoth, Jacobmoved forward and pitched his tent near Shechem (q.v.), 33:18;but at length, under divine directions, he moved to Bethel,where he made an altar unto God (35:6, 7), and where Godappeared to him and renewed the Abrahamic covenant. Whilejourneying from Bethel to Ephrath (the Canaanitish name ofBethlehem), Rachel died in giving birth to her second sonBenjamin (35:16-20), fifteen or sixteen years after the birth ofJoseph. He then reached the old family residence at Mamre, towait on the dying bed of his father Isaac. The completereconciliation between Esau and Jacob was shown by their unitingin the burial of the patriarch (35:27-29).<br><br>Jacob was soon after this deeply grieved by the loss of hisbeloved son Joseph through the jealousy of his brothers (37:33).Then follows the story of the famine, and the successive goingsdown into Egypt to buy corn (42), which led to the discovery ofthe long-lost Joseph, and the patriarch\'s going down with allhis household, numbering about seventy souls (Ex. 1:5; Deut.10:22; Acts 7:14), to sojourn in the land of Goshen. Here Jacob,\"after being strangely tossed about on a very rough ocean, foundat last a tranquil harbour, where all the best affections of hisnature were gently exercised and largely unfolded\" (Gen. 48). Atlength the end of his checkered course draws nigh, and hesummons his sons to his bedside that he may bless them. Amonghis last words he repeats the story of Rachel\'s death, althoughforty years had passed away since that event took place, astenderly as if it had happened only yesterday; and when \"he hadmade an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet intothe bed, and yielded up the ghost\" (49:33). His body wasembalmed and carried with great pomp into the land of Canaan,and buried beside his wife Leah in the cave of Machpelah,according to his dying charge. There, probably, his embalmedbody remains to this day (50:1-13). (See [305]HEBRON.)<br><br>The history of Jacob is referred to by the prophets Hosea (12:3,4, 12) and Malachi (1:2). In Micah 1:5 the name is a poeticsynonym for Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes.

It still exists, but although aftercopious rains it contains a little water, it is now usuallyquite dry. It is at the entrance to the valley between Ebal andGerizim, about 2 miles south-east of Shechem. It is about 9 feetin diameter and about 75 feet in depth, though in ancient timesit was no doubt much deeper, probably twice as deep. The diggingof such a well must have been a very laborious and costlyundertaking.<br><br>\"Unfortunately, the well of Jacob has not escaped that misplacedreligious veneration which cannot be satisfied with leaving theobject of it as it is, but must build over it a shrine toprotect and make it sacred. A series of buildings of variousstyles, and of different ages, have cumbered the ground, chokedup the well, and disfigured the natural beauty and simplicity ofthe spot. At present the rubbish in the well has been clearedout; but there is still a domed structure over it, and you gazedown the shaft cut in the living rock and see at a depth of 70feet the surface of the water glimmering with a pale blue lightin the darkness, while you notice how the limestone blocks thatform its curb have been worn smooth, or else furrowed by theropes of centuries\" (Hugh Macmillan).<br><br>At the entrance of the enclosure round the well is planted inthe ground one of the wooden poles that hold the telegraph wiresbetween Jerusalem and Haifa.<br><br>'),

He was further helped by his ally theking of Edom. Elisha went forth with the confederated army (2Kings 3:1-19), and at the solicitation of Jehoshaphat encouragedthe army with the assurance from the Lord of a speedy victory.The Moabites under Mesha their king were utterly routed andtheir cities destroyed.

His wife was Athaliah, thedaughter of Ahab and Jezebel. His daughter Jehosheba was marriedto the high priest Jehoiada. He sank into gross idolatry, andbrought upon himself and his kingdom the anger of Jehovah. TheEdomites revolted from under his yoke, and the Philistines andthe Arabians and Cushites invaded the land, and carried awaygreat spoil, along with Jehoram\'s wives and all his children,except Ahaziah.

A new fleet was fitted out without theco-operation of the king of Israel, and although it wassuccessful, the trade was not prosecuted (2 Chr. 20:35-37; 1Kings 22:48-49).<br><br>He subsequently joined Jehoram, king of Israel, in a war againstthe Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war wassuccessful. The Moabites were subdued; but the dreadful act ofMesha in offering his own son a sacrifice on the walls ofKir-haresheth in the sight of the armies of Israel filled himwith horror, and he withdrew and returned to his own land (2Kings 3:4-27).<br><br>The last most notable event of his reign was that recorded in 2Chr. 20. The Moabites formed a great and powerful confederacywith the surrounding nations, and came against Jehoshaphat. Theallied forces were encamped at Engedi.

So it was,for they quarrelled among themselves, and slew one another,leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils ofthe slain. This was recognized as a great deliverance wroughtfor them by God (B.C. 890). Soon after this Jehoshaphat died,after a reign of twenty-five years, being sixty years of age,and was succeeded by his son Jehoram (1 Kings 22:50).

The Massorets gave to it the vowel-pointsappropriate to this word. This Jewish practice was founded on afalse interpretation of Lev. 24:16. The meaning of the wordappears from Ex. 3:14 to be \"the unchanging, eternal,self-existent God,\" the \"I am that I am,\" a convenant-keepingGod. (Comp.

King of Israel, the son of Jehoshaphat (2 Kings 9:2), andgrandson of Nimshi. The story of his exaltation to the throne isdeeply interesting. During the progress of a war against theSyrians, who were becoming more and more troublesome to Israel,in a battle at Ramoth-gilead Jehoram, the king of Israel, hadbeen wounded; and leaving his army there, had returned toJezreel, whither his ally, Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also goneon a visit of sympathy with him (2 Kings 8:28, 29). Thecommanders, being left in charge of the conduct of the war, metin council; and while engaged in their deliberations, amessenger from Elisha appeared in the camp, and taking Jehu fromthe council, led him into a secret chamber, and there anointedhim king over Israel, and immediately retired and disappeared (2Kings 9:5, 6). On being interrogated by his companions as to theobject of this mysterious visitor, he informed them of what hadbeen done, when immediately, with the utmost enthusiasm, theyblew their trumpets and proclaimed him king (2 Kings 9:11-14).He then with a chosen band set forth with all speed to Jezreel,where, with his own hand, he slew Jehoram, shooting him throughthe heart with an arrow (9:24). The king of Judah, when tryingto escape, was fatally wounded by one of Jehu\'s soldiers atBeth-gan. On entering the city, Jehu commanded the eunchs of theroyal palace to cast down Jezebel into the street, where hermangled body was trodden under foot by the horses. Jehu was nowmaster of Jezreel, whence he communicated with the persons inauthority in Samaria the capital, commanding them to appearbefore him on the morrow with the heads of all the royal princesof Samaria. Accordingly on the morrow seventy heads were piledup in two heaps at his gate.

It was a rich and flourishing town, having aconsiderable trade, and celebrated for the palm trees whichadorned the plain around. It was visited by our Lord on his lastjourney to Jerusalem. Here he gave sight to two blind men (Matt.20:29-34; Mark 10:46-52), and brought salvation to the house ofZacchaeus the publican (Luke 19:2-10).<br><br>The poor hamlet of er-Riha, the representative of modernJericho, is situated some two miles farther to the east.

Influenced by the words of theprophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the view ofbecoming king of the ten tribes; but these having beendiscovered, he fled to Egypt (1 Kings 11:29-40), where heremained for a length of time under the protection of Shishak I.On the death of Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sentto invite him to become their king. The conduct of Rehoboamfavoured the designs of Jeroboam, and he was accordinglyproclaimed \"king of Israel\" (1 Kings 12: 1-20). He rebuilt andfortified Shechem as the capital of his kingdom. He at onceadopted means to perpetuate the division thus made between thetwo parts of the kingdom, and erected at Dan and Bethel, the twoextremities of his kingdom, \"golden calves,\" which he set up assymbols of Jehovah, enjoining the people not any more to go upto worship at Jerusalem, but to bring their offerings to theshrines he had erected.

This name is in the originalin the dual form, and means \"possession of peace,\" or\"foundation of peace.\" The dual form probably refers to the twomountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, assome suppose, to the two parts of the city, the \"upper\" and the\"lower city.\" Jerusalem is a \"mountain city enthroned on amountain fastness\" (comp. Ps. 68:15, 16; 87:1; 125:2; 76:1, 2;122:3). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-landsin Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, thesouthern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.<br><br>It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem (Gen.14:18; comp. Ps. 76:2). When first mentioned under the nameJerusalem, Adonizedek was its king (Josh. 10:1). It isafterwards named among the cities of Benjamin (Judg. 19:10; 1Chr. 11:4); but in the time of David it was divided betweenBenjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was takenand set on fire by the men of Judah (Judg. 1:1-8); but theJebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is notagain mentioned till we are told that David brought the head ofGoliath thither (1 Sam. 17:54). David afterwards led his forcesagainst the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drovethem out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called \"thecity of David\" (2 Sam. 5:5-9; 1 Chr. 11:4-8). Here he built analtar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite(2 Sam. 24:15-25), and thither he brought up the ark of thecovenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he hadprepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of thekingdom.<br><br>After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house forthe name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He alsogreatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became thegreat centre of all the civil and religious affairs of thenation (Deut. 12:5; comp. 12:14; 14:23; 16:11-16; Ps. 122).<br><br>After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to thethrone of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became thecapital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequentlyoften taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and bythe kings of Israel (2 Kings 14:13, 14; 18:15, 16; 23:33-35;24:14; 2 Chr. 12:9; 26:9; 27:3, 4; 29:3; 32:30; 33:11), tillfinally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after asiege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, itswalls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumedby fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon (2 Kings 25; 2Chr. 36; Jer. 39), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and theland was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews intoEgypt (Jer. 40-44), and by the final carrying captive intoBabylon of all that still remained in the land (52:3), so thatit was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare thepredictions, Deut. 28; Lev. 26:14-39.<br><br>But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built,in troublous times (Dan. 9:16, 19, 25), after a captivity ofseventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, \"in thefirst year of Cyrus\" (Ezra 1:2, 3, 5-11). The Books of Ezra andNehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city andtemple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews,consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thusconstituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia,till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half,under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. Fora century the Jews maintained their independence under nativerulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period theyfell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, butpractically under Rome, till the time of the destruction ofJerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.<br><br>The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over theimmense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of theancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site,there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets arenow what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jewswho still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to theRoman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order tohold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. TheJews, however, took possession of it, having risen under theleadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., \"the son of the star\") inrevolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D.135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter,and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built aRoman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it retainedtill it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it wascalled el-Khuds, i.e., \"the holy.\"<br><br>In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made apilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the placesmentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a church to bebuilt on what was then supposed to be the place of the nativityat Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched forthe holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site amagnificent church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335.He relaxed the laws against the Jews till this time in force,and permitted them once a year to visit the city and wail overthe desolation of \"the holy and beautiful house.\"<br><br>In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces ofthe emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained ittill A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under theKhalif Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, inA.D. 960, under the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt,and in A.D. 1073 under the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusaderGodfrey of Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with greatslaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted theMosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During theeighty-eight years which followed, many churches and conventswere erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchrewas rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to thisday. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from theChristians. From that time to the present day, with fewintervals, Jerusalem has remained in the hands of the Moslems.It has, however, during that period been again and again takenand retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no city inthe world having passed through so many vicissitudes.<br><br>In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalemhad a fierce dispute about the guardianship of what are calledthe \"holy places.\" In this dispute the emperor Nicholas ofRussia sided with the Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor ofthe French, with the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities tosettle the question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out ofthis there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted andsanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way ofbreaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.<br><br>Modern Jerusalem \"lies near the summit of a broadmountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from theplain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end ofthe Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean.\"This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as themountains of Ephraim and Judah.<br><br>\"Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely fromDamascus, not merely because it is a stone town in mountains,whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while inDamascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed withany foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, everynationality of East and West, is represented at one time.\"<br><br>Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book ofJoshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets includessix letters from its Amorite king to Egypt, recording the attackof the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name is there spelt Uru-Salim(\"city of peace\"). Another monumental record in which the HolyCity is named is that of Sennacherib\'s attack in B.C. 702. The\"camp of the Assyrians\" was still shown about A.D. 70, on theflat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter ofthe city.<br><br>The city of David included both the upper city and Millo, andwas surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon, who appearto have restored the original Jebusite fortifications. The nameZion (or Sion) appears to have been, like Ariel (\"the hearth ofGod\"), a poetical term for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age wasmore specially used of the Temple hill. The priests\' quartergrew up on Ophel, south of the Temple, where also was Solomon\'sPalace outside the original city of David. The walls of the citywere extended by Jotham and Manasseh to include this suburb andthe Temple (2 Chr. 27:3; 33:14).<br><br>Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000 inhabitants, with ancientmediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but extending less farto the south.

He wasa child of probably six years of age when his father returnedfrom Haran to Canaan and took up his residence in the oldpatriarchal town of Hebron. \"Now Israel loved Joseph more thanall his children, because he was the son of his old age,\" and he\"made him a long garment with sleeves\" (Gen. 37:3, R.V. marg.),i.e., a garment long and full, such as was worn by the childrenof nobles. This seems to be the correct rendering of the words.The phrase, however, may also be rendered, \"a coat of manypieces\", i.e., a patchwork of many small pieces of diverscolours.<br><br>When he was about seventeen years old Joseph incurred thejealous hatred of his brothers (Gen. 37:4). They \"hated him, andcould not speak peaceably unto him.\" Their anger was increasedwhen he told them his dreams (37:11).<br><br>Jacob desiring to hear tidings of his sons, who had gone toShechem with their flocks, some 60 miles from Hebron, sentJoseph as his messenger to make inquiry regarding them. Josephfound that they had left Shechem for Dothan, whither he followedthem. As soon as they saw him coming they began to plot againsthim, and would have killed him had not Reuben interposed. Theyultimately sold him to a company of Ishmaelite merchants fortwenty pieces (shekels) of silver (about $2, 10s.), ten piecesless than the current value of a slave, for \"they cared littlewhat they had for him, if so be they were rid of him.\" Thesemerchants were going down with a varied assortment ofmerchandise to the Egyptian market, and thither they conveyedhim, and ultimately sold him as a slave to Potiphar, an \"officerof Pharaoh\'s, and captain of the guard\" (Gen. 37:36). \"The Lordblessed the Egyptian\'s house for Joseph\'s sake,\" and Potipharmade him overseer over his house. At length a false chargehaving been brought against him by Potiphar\'s wife, he was atonce cast into the state prison (39; 40), where he remained forat least two years. After a while the \"chief of the cupbearers\"and the \"chief of the bakers\" of Pharaoh\'s household were castinto the same prison (40:2). Each of these new prisoners dreameda dream in the same night, which Joseph interpreted, the eventoccurring as he had said.<br><br>This led to Joseph\'s being remembered subsequently by the chiefbutler when Pharaoh also dreamed. At his suggestion Joseph wasbrought from prison to interpret the king\'s dreams. Pharaoh waswell pleased with Joseph\'s wisdom in interpreting his dreams,and with his counsel with reference to the events thenpredicted; and he set him over all the land of Egypt (Gen.41:46), and gave him the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. He wasmarried to Asenath, the daughter of the priest of On, and thusbecame a member of the priestly class. Joseph was now aboutthirty years of age.<br><br>As Joseph had interpreted, seven years of plenty came, duringwhich he stored up great abundance of corn in granaries builtfor the purpose. These years were followed by seven years offamine \"over all the face of the earth,\" when \"all countriescame into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn\" (Gen. 41:56, 57; 47:13,14). Thus \"Joseph gathered up all the money that was in the landof Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which theybought.\" Afterwards all the cattle and all the land, and at lastthe Egyptians themselves, became the property of Pharaoh.<br><br>During this period of famine Joseph\'s brethren also came down toEgypt to buy corn. The history of his dealings with them, and ofthe manner in which he at length made himself known to them, isone of the most interesting narratives that can be read (Gen.42-45). Joseph directed his brethren to return and bring Jacoband his family to the land of Egypt, saying, \"I will give youthe good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of theland. Regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land isyours.\" Accordingly Jacob and his family, to the number ofthreescore and ten souls, together with \"all that they had,\"went down to Egypt. They were settled in the land of Goshen,where Joseph met his father, and \"fell on his neck, and wept onhis neck a good while\" (Gen. 46:29).<br><br>The excavations of Dr. Naville have shown the land of Goshen tobe the Wady Tumilat, between Ismailia and Zagazig. In Goshen(Egyptian Qosem) they had pasture for their flocks, were nearthe Asiatic frontier of Egypt, and were out of the way of theEgyptian people. An inscription speaks of it as a district givenup to the wandering shepherds of Asia.<br><br>Jacob at length died, and in fulfilment of a promise which hehad exacted, Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father in \"thefield of Ephron the Hittite\" (Gen. 47:29-31; 50:1-14).

Another difficulty arises out of the command given by Godutterly to exterminate the Canaanites. \"Shall not the Judge ofall the earth do right?\" It is enough that Joshua clearly knewthat this was the will of God, who employs his terribleagencies, famine, pestilence, and war, in the righteousgovernment of this world. The Canaanites had sunk into a stateof immorality and corruption so foul and degrading that they hadto be rooted out of the land with the edge of the sword. \"TheIsraelites\' sword, in its bloodiest executions, wrought a workof mercy for all the countries of the earth to the very end ofthe world.\"<br><br>This book resembles the Acts of the Apostles in the number andvariety of historical incidents it records, and in its manyreferences to persons and places; and as in the latter case theepistles of Paul (see Paley\'s Horae Paul.) confirm itshistorical accuracy by their incidental allusions and\"undesigned coincidences,\" so in the former modern discoveriesconfirm its historicity. The Amarna tablets (see[323]ADONIZEDEC) are among the most remarkable discoveries ofthe age. Dating from about B.C. 1480 down to the time of Joshua,and consisting of official communications from Amorite,Phoenician, and Philistine chiefs to the king of Egypt, theyafford a glimpse into the actual condition of Palestine prior tothe Hebrew invasion, and illustrate and confirm the history ofthe conquest. A letter, also still extant, from a militaryofficer, \"master of the captains of Egypt,\" dating from near theend of the reign of Rameses II., gives a curious account of ajourney, probably official, which he undertook through Palestineas far north as to Aleppo, and an insight into the socialcondition of the country at that time. Among the things broughtto light by this letter and the Amarna tablets is the state ofconfusion and decay that had now fallen on Egypt. The Egyptiangarrisons that had held possession of Palestine from the time ofThothmes III., some two hundred years before, had now beenwithdrawn. The way was thus opened for the Hebrews. In thehistory of the conquest there is no mention of Joshua havingencountered any Egyptian force. The tablets contain many appealsto the king of Egypt for help against the inroads of theHebrews, but no help seems ever to have been sent. Is not thisjust such a state of things as might have been anticipated asthe result of the disaster of the Exodus? In many points, asshown under various articles, the progress of the conquest isremarkably illustrated by the tablets. The value of moderndiscoveries in their relation to Old Testament history has beenthus well described:<br><br>\"The difficulty of establishing the charge of lack of historicalcredibility, as against the testimony of the Old Testament, hasof late years greatly increased. The outcome of recentexcavations and explorations is altogether against it. As longas these books contained, in the main, the only known accountsof the events they mention, there was some plausibility in thetheory that perhaps these accounts were written rather to teachmoral lessons than to preserve an exact knowledge of events. Itwas easy to say in those times men had not the historic sense.But the recent discoveries touch the events recorded in theBible at very many different points in many differentgenerations, mentioning the same persons, countries, peoples,events that are mentioned in the Bible, and showing beyondquestion that these were strictly historic. The point is notthat the discoveries confirm the correctness of the Biblicalstatements, though that is commonly the case, but that thediscoveries show that the peoples of those ages had the historicsense, and, specifically, that the Biblical narratives theytouch are narratives of actual occurrences.\"<br><br>'),

Josiah immediately gatheredthe people together, and engaged them in a renewal of theirancient national covenant with God.

In addition to the pardon (q.v.)of sin, justification declares that all the claims of the laware satisfied in respect of the justified. It is the act of ajudge and not of a sovereign. The law is not relaxed or setaside, but is declared to be fulfilled in the strictest sense;and so the person justified is declared to be entitled to allthe advantages and rewards arising from perfect obedience to thelaw (Rom. 5:1-10).<br><br>It proceeds on the imputing or crediting to the believer by Godhimself of the perfect righteousness, active and passive, of hisRepresentative and Surety, Jesus Christ (Rom. 10:3-9).Justification is not the forgiveness of a man withoutrighteousness, but a declaration that he possesses arighteousness which perfectly and for ever satisfies the law,namely, Christ\'s righteousness (2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 4:6-8).<br><br>The sole condition on which this righteousness is imputed orcredited to the believer is faith in or on the Lord JesusChrist.

We have the description of thedisease, as well as the regulations connected with it, in Lev.13; 14; Num. 12:10-15, etc. There were reckoned six differentcircumstances under which it might develop itself, (1) withoutany apparent cause (Lev. 13:2-8); (2) its reappearance (9-17);(3) from an inflammation (18-28); (4) on the head or chin(29-37); (5) in white polished spots (38, 39); (6) at the backor in the front of the head (40-44).<br><br>Lepers were required to live outside the camp or city (Num.5:1-4; 12:10-15, etc.). This disease was regarded as an awfulpunishment from the Lord (2 Kings 5:7; 2 Chr. 26:20). (See[351]MIRIAM; [352]GEHAZI; [353]UZZIAH.)<br><br>This disease \"begins with specks on the eyelids and on thepalms, gradually spreading over the body, bleaching the hairwhite wherever they appear, crusting the affected parts withwhite scales, and causing terrible sores and swellings. From theskin the disease eats inward to the bones, rotting the wholebody piecemeal.\" \"In Christ\'s day no leper could live in awalled town, though he might in an open village. But wherever hewas he was required to have his outer garment rent as a sign ofdeep grief, to go bareheaded, and to cover his beard with hismantle, as if in lamentation at his own virtual death. He hadfurther to warn passers-by to keep away from him, by callingout, Unclean! unclean!\' nor could he speak to any one, orreceive or return a salutation, since in the East this involvesan embrace.\"<br><br>That the disease was not contagious is evident from theregulations regarding it (Lev. 13:12, 13, 36; 2 Kings 5:1).Leprosy was \"the outward and visible sign of the innermostspiritual corruption; a meet emblem in its small beginnings, itsgradual spread, its internal disfigurement, its dissolutionlittle by little of the whole body, of that which corrupts,degrades, and defiles man\'s inner nature, and renders him unmeetto enter the presence of a pure and holy God\" (Maclear\'sHandbook O.T). Our Lord cured lepers (Matt. 8:2, 3; Mark1:40-42). This divine power so manifested illustrates hisgracious dealings with men in curing the leprosy of the soul,the fatal taint of sin.<br><br>'),

At Sinai the first change inthis ancient practice was made. A hereditary priesthood in thefamily of Aaron was then instituted (Ex. 28:1). But it was nottill that terrible scene in connection with the sin of thegolden calf that the tribe of Levi stood apart and began tooccupy a distinct position (Ex. 32). The religious primogeniturewas then conferred on this tribe, which henceforth was devotedto the service of the sanctuary (Num. 3:11-13). They wereselected for this purpose because of their zeal for the glory ofGod (Ex. 32:26), and because, as the tribe to which Moses andAaron belonged, they would naturally stand by the lawgiver inhis work.<br><br>The Levitical order consisted of all the descendants of Levi\'sthree sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; whilst Aaron, Amram\'sson (Amram, son of Kohat), and his issue constituted thepriestly order.<br><br>The age and qualification for Levitical service are specified inNum. 4:3, 23, 30, 39, 43, 47.<br><br>They were not included among the armies of Israel (Num. 1:47;2:33; 26:62), but were reckoned by themselves.

TheGershonites pitched their tents on the west of the tabernacle(3:23), the Kohathites on the south (3:29), the Merarites on thenorth (3:35), and the priests on the east (3:38). It was theirduty to move the tent and carry the parts of the sacredstructure from place to place. They were given to Aaron and hissons the priests to wait upon them and do work for them at thesanctuary services (Num. 8:19; 18:2-6).<br><br>As being wholly consecrated to the service of the Lord, they hadno territorial possessions. Jehovah was their inheritance (Num.18:20; 26:62; Deut. 10:9; 18:1, 2), and for their support it wasordained that they should receive from the other tribes thetithes of the produce of the land. Forty-eight cities also wereassigned to them, thirteen of which were for the priests \"todwell in\", i.e., along with their other inhabitants. Along withtheir dwellings they had \"suburbs\", i.e., \"commons\", for theirherds and flocks, and also fields and vineyards (Num. 35:2-5).Nine of these cities were in Judah, three in Naphtali, and fourin each of the other tribes (Josh. 21).

This territory on the east of Jordan was morevaluable and of larger extent than all that was allotted to thenine and a half tribes in the land of Palestine. It is sometimescalled \"the land of Gilead,\" and is also spoken of as \"on theother side of Jordan.\" The portion given to the half tribe ofManasseh was the largest on the east of Jordan.

Though hereigned so long, yet comparatively little is known of this king.His reign was a continuation of that of Ahaz, both in religionand national polity. He early fell under the influence of theheathen court circle, and his reign was characterized by a sadrelapse into idolatry with all its vices, showing that thereformation under his father had been to a large extent onlysuperficial (Isa. 7:10; 2 Kings 21:10-15). A systematic andpersistent attempt was made, and all too successfully, to banishthe worship of Jehovah out of the land. Amid this wide-spreadidolatry there were not wanting, however, faithful prophets(Isaiah, Micah) who lifted up their voice in reproof and inwarning. But their fidelity only aroused bitter hatred, and aperiod of cruel persecution against all the friends of the oldreligion began. \"The days of Alva in Holland, of Charles IX. inFrance, or of the Covenanters under Charles II. in Scotland,were anticipated in the Jewish capital. The streets were redwith blood.\" There is an old Jewish tradition that Isaiah wasput to death at this time (2 Kings 21:16; 24:3, 4; Jer. 2:30),having been sawn asunder in the trunk of a tree. Psalms 49, 73,77, 140, and 141 seem to express the feelings of the pious amidthe fiery trials of this great persecution. Manasseh has beencalled the \"Nero of Palestine.\"<br><br>Esarhaddon, Sennacherib\'s successor on the Assyrian throne, whohad his residence in Babylon for thirteen years (the onlyAssyrian monarch who ever reigned in Babylon), took Manassehprisoner (B.C. 681) to Babylon. Such captive kings were usuallytreated with great cruelty. They were brought before theconqueror with a hook or ring passed through their lips or theirjaws, having a cord attached to it, by which they were led. Thisis referred to in 2 Chr. 33:11, where the Authorized Versionreads that Esarhaddon \"took Manasseh among the thorns;\" whilethe Revised Version renders the words, \"took Manasseh inchains;\" or literally, as in the margin, \"with hooks.\" (Comp. 2Kings 19:28.)<br><br>The severity of Manasseh\'s imprisonment brought him torepentance. God heard his cry, and he was restored to hiskingdom (2 Chr. 33:11-13). He abandoned his idolatrous ways, andenjoined the people to worship Jehovah; but there was nothorough reformation. After a lengthened reign extending throughfifty-five years, the longest in the history of Judah, he died,and was buried in the garden of Uzza, the \"garden of his ownhouse\" (2 Kings 21:17, 18; 2 Chr. 33:20), and not in the city ofDavid, among his ancestors. He was succeeded by his son Amon.<br><br>In Judg. 18:30 the correct reading is \"Moses,\" and not\"Manasseh.\" The name \"Manasseh\" is supposed to have beenintroduced by some transcriber to avoid the scandal of namingthe grandson of Moses the great lawgiver as the founder of anidolatrous religion.<br><br>'),

If any was kept over till thefollowing morning, it became corrupt with worms; but as on theSabbath none fell, on the preceding day a double portion wasgiven, and that could be kept over to supply the wants of theSabbath without becoming corrupt. Directions concerning thegathering of it are fully given (Ex. 16:16-18, 33; Deut. 8:3,16). It fell for the first time after the eighth encampment inthe desert of Sin, and was daily furnished, except on theSabbath, for all the years of the wanderings, till they encampedat Gilgal, after crossing the Jordan, when it suddenly ceased,and where they \"did eat of the old corn of the land; neither hadthe children of Israel manna any more\" (Josh. 5:12).

But ingeneral the marriage was celebrated by a feast in the house ofthe bride\'s parents, to which all friends were invited (29:22,27); and on the day of the marriage the bride, concealed under athick veil, was conducted to her future husband\'s home.<br><br>Our Lord corrected many false notions then existing on thesubject of marriage (Matt. 22:23-30), and placed it as a divineinstitution on the highest grounds. The apostles state clearlyand enforce the nuptial duties of husband and wife (Eph.5:22-33; Col. 3:18, 19; 1 Pet. 3:1-7). Marriage is said to be\"honourable\" (Heb. 13:4), and the prohibition of it is noted asone of the marks of degenerate times (1 Tim. 4:3).<br><br>The marriage relation is used to represent the union between Godand his people (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:1-14; Hos. 2:9, 20). In theNew Testament the same figure is employed in representing thelove of Christ to his saints (Eph. 5:25-27). The Church of theredeemed is the \"Bride, the Lamb\'s wife\" (Rev. 19:7-9).<br><br>'),

The mosthonoured guests sit nearest, others behind; and all in eatingdip their hand into the one smoking mound, pieces of the thinbread, bent together, serving for spoons when necessary. Afterthe first circle have satisfied themselves, those lower inhonour sit down to the rest, the whole company being men, forwomen are never seen at a feast. Water is poured on the handsbefore eating; and this is repeated when the meal closes, thefingers having first been wiped on pieces of bread, which, afterserving the same purpose as table-napkins with us, are thrown onthe ground to be eaten by any dog that may have stolen in fromthe streets through the ever-open door, or picked up by thoseoutside when gathered and tossed out to them (Matt. 15:27; Mark7:28). Rising from the ground and retiring to the seats roundthe walls, the guests then sit down cross-legged and gossip, orlisten to recitals, or puzzle over riddles, light being scantilysupplied by a small lamp or two, or if the night be chilly, by asmouldering fire of weeds kindled in the middle of the room,perhaps in a brazier, often in a hole in the floor. As to thesmoke, it escapes as it best may; but indeed there is little ofit, though enough to blacken the water or wine or milk skinshung up on pegs on the wall. (Comp. Ps. 119:83.)

From the residence being called \"herhouse,\" some have supposed that she was a widow, and that herbrother and sister lodged with her. She seems to have been of ananxious, bustling spirit, anxious to be helpful in providing thebest things for the Master\'s use, in contrast to the quietearnestness of Mary, who was more concerned to avail herself ofthe opportunity of sitting at his feet and learning of him.Afterwards at a supper given to Christ and his disciples in herhouse \"Martha served.\" Nothing further is known of her.<br><br>\"Mary and Martha are representatives of two orders of humancharacter.

(2428, 'Mary', 'Hebrew Miriam. (1.) The wife of Joseph, the mother of Jesus,called the \"Virgin Mary,\" though never so designated inScripture (Matt. 2:11; Acts 1:14). Little is known of herpersonal history. Her genealogy is given in Luke 3. She was ofthe tribe of Judah and the lineage of David (Ps. 132:11; Luke1:32). She was connected by marriage with Elisabeth, who was ofthe lineage of Aaron (Luke 1:36).<br><br>While she resided at Nazareth with her parents, before shebecame the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel announced to herthat she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah (Luke1:35). After this she went to visit her cousin Elisabeth, whowas living with her husband Zacharias (probably at Juttah, Josh.15:55; 21:16, in the neighbourhood of Maon), at a considerabledistance, about 100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately onentering the house she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother ofher Lord, and then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn ofthanksgiving (Luke 1:46-56; comp. 1 Sam. 2:1-10). After threemonths Mary returned to Nazareth to her own home. Joseph wassupernaturally made aware (Matt. 1:18-25) of her condition, andtook her to his own home. Soon after this the decree of Augustus(Luke 2:1) required that they should proceed to Bethlehem (Micah5:2), some 80 or 90 miles from Nazareth; and while they werethere they found shelter in the inn or khan provided forstrangers (Luke 2:6, 7). But as the inn was crowded, Mary had toretire to a place among the cattle, and there she brought forthher son, who was called Jesus (Matt. 1:21), because he was tosave his people from their sins. This was followed by thepresentation in the temple, the flight into Egypt, and theirreturn in the following year and residence at Nazareth (Matt.2). There for thirty years Mary, the wife of Joseph thecarpenter, resides, filling her own humble sphere, and ponderingover the strange things that had happened to her. During theseyears only one event in the history of Jesus is recorded, viz.,his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, and hisbeing found among the doctors in the temple (Luke 2:41-52).Probably also during this period Joseph died, for he is notagain mentioned.<br><br>After the commencement of our Lord\'s public ministry littlenotice is taken of Mary. She was present at the marriage inCana. A year and a half after this we find her at Capernaum(Matt. 12:46, 48, 49), where Christ uttered the memorable words,\"Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretchedforth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my motherand my brethren!\" The next time we find her is at the crossalong with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, andother women (John 19:26). From that hour John took her to hisown abode. She was with the little company in the upper roomafter the Ascension (Acts 1:14). From this time she whollydisappears from public notice. The time and manner of her deathare unknown.<br><br>(2.) Mary Magdalene, i.e., Mary of Magdala, a town on thewestern shore of the Lake of Tiberias. She is for the first timenoticed in Luke 8:3 as one of the women who \"ministered toChrist of their substance.\" Their motive was that of gratitudefor deliverances he had wrought for them. Out of Mary were castseven demons. Gratitude to her great Deliverer prompted her tobecome his follower. These women accompanied him also on hislast journey to Jerusalem (Matt. 27:55; Mark 15:41; Luke 23:55).They stood near the cross. There Mary remained till all wasover, and the body was taken down and laid in Joseph\'s tomb.Again, in the earliest dawn of the first day of the week she,with Salome and Mary the mother of James (Matt. 28:1; Mark16:2), came to the sepulchre, bringing with them sweet spices,that they might anoint the body of Jesus. They found thesepulchre empty, but saw the \"vision of angels\" (Matt. 28:5).She hastens to tell Peter and John, who were probably livingtogether at this time (John 20:1, 2), and again immediatelyreturns to the sepulchre. There she lingers thoughtfully,weeping at the door of the tomb. The risen Lord appears to her,but at first she knows him not. His utterance of her name \"Mary\"recalls her to consciousness, and she utters the joyful,reverent cry, \"Rabboni.\" She would fain cling to him, but heforbids her, saying, \"Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended tomy Father.\" This is the last record regarding Mary of Magdala,who now returned to Jerusalem. The idea that this Mary was \"thewoman who was a sinner,\" or that she was unchaste, is altogethergroundless.<br><br>(3.) Mary the sister of Lazarus is brought to our notice inconnection with the visits of our Lord to Bethany. She iscontrasted with her sister Martha, who was \"cumbered about manythings\" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen \"thegood part.\" Her character also appears in connection with thedeath of her brother (John 11:20, 31, 33). On the occasion ofour Lord\'s last visit to Bethany, Mary brought \"a pound ofointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet ofJesus\" as he reclined at table in the house of one Simon, whohad been a leper (Matt. 26:6; Mark 14:3; John 12:2, 3). This wasan evidence of her overflowing love to the Lord. Nothing isknown of her subsequent history. It would appear from this actof Mary\'s, and from the circumstance that they possessed afamily vault (11:38), and that a large number of Jews fromJerusalem came to condole with them on the death of Lazarus(11:19), that this family at Bethany belonged to the wealthierclass of the people. (See [382]MARTHA.)<br><br>(4.) Mary the wife of Cleopas is mentioned (John 19:25) asstanding at the cross in company with Mary of Magdala and Marythe mother of Jesus. By comparing Matt. 27:56 and Mark 15:40, wefind that this Mary and \"Mary the mother of James the little\"are on and the same person, and that she was the sister of ourLord\'s mother. She was that \"other Mary\" who was present withMary of Magdala at the burial of our Lord (Matt. 27:61; Mark15:47); and she was one of those who went early in the morningof the first day of the week to anoint the body, and thus becameone of the first witnesses of the resurrection (Matt. 28:1; Mark16:1; Luke 24:1).<br><br>(5.) Mary the mother of John Mark was one of the earliest of ourLord\'s disciples. She was the sister of Barnabas (Col. 4:10),and joined with him in disposing of their land and giving theproceeds of the sale into the treasury of the Church (Acts 4:37;12:12).

He wasafterwards selected as one of the twelve (6:15). His name doesnot occur again in the Gospel history except in the lists of theapostles. The last notice of him is in Acts 1:13.

(2443, 'Matthew, Gospel according to', 'The author of this book was beyond a doubt the Matthew, anapostle of our Lord, whose name it bears. He wrote the Gospel ofChrist according to his own plans and aims, and from his ownpoint of view, as did also the other \"evangelists.\"<br><br>As to the time of its composition, there is little in the Gospelitself to indicate. It was evidently written before thedestruction of Jerusalem (Matt. 24), and some time after theevents it records. The probability is that it was writtenbetween the years A.D. 60 and 65.<br><br>The cast of thought and the forms of expression employed by thewriter show that this Gospel was written for Jewish Christiansof Palestine. His great object is to prove that Jesus ofNazareth was the promised Messiah, and that in him the ancientprophecies had their fulfilment. The Gospel is full of allusionsto those passages of the Old Testament in which Christ ispredicted and foreshadowed. The one aim prevading the whole bookis to show that Jesus is he \"of whom Moses in the law and theprophets did write.\" This Gospel contains no fewer thansixty-five references to the Old Testament, forty-three of thesebeing direct verbal citations, thus greatly outnumbering thosefound in the other Gospels. The main feature of this Gospel maybe expressed in the motto, \"I am not come to destroy, but tofulfil.\"<br><br>As to the language in which this Gospel was written there ismuch controversy. Many hold, in accordance with old tradition,that it was originally written in Hebrew (i.e., the Aramaic orSyro-Chaldee dialect, then the vernacular of the inhabitants ofPalestine), and afterwards translated into Greek, either byMatthew himself or by some person unknown. This theory, thoughearnestly maintained by able critics, we cannot see any groundfor adopting. From the first this Gospel in Greek was receivedas of authority in the Church. There is nothing in it to showthat it is a translation. Though Matthew wrote mainly for theJews, yet they were everywhere familiar with the Greek language.The same reasons which would have suggested the necessity of atranslation into Greek would have led the evangelist to write inGreek at first. It is confessed that this Gospel has never beenfound in any other form than that in which we now possess it.<br><br>The leading characteristic of this Gospel is that it sets forththe kingly glory of Christ, and shows him to be the true heir toDavid\'s throne. It is the Gospel of the kingdom. Matthew usesthe expression \"kingdom of heaven\" (thirty-two times), whileLuke uses the expression \"kingdom of God\" (thirty-three times).Some Latinized forms occur in this Gospel, as kodrantes (Matt.5:26), for the Latin quadrans, and phragello (27:26), for theLatin flagello. It must be remembered that Matthew was atax-gatherer for the Roman government, and hence in contact withthose using the Latin language.<br><br>As to the relation of the Gospels to each other, we mustmaintain that each writer of the synoptics (the first three)wrote independently of the other two, Matthew being probablyfirst in point of time.<br><br>\"Out of a total of 1071 verses, Matthew has 387 in common withMark and Luke, 130 with Mark, 184 with Luke; only 387 beingpeculiar to itself.\" (See [383]MARK; [384]LUKE; [385]GOSPELS.)<br><br>The book is fitly divided into these four parts: (1.)

(2561, 'Miracle', 'An event in the external world brought about by the immediateagency or the simple volition of God, operating without the useof means capable of being discerned by the senses, and designedto authenticate the divine commission of a religious teacher andthe truth of his message (John 2:18; Matt. 12:38). It is anoccurrence at once above nature and above man. It shows theintervention of a power that is not limited by the laws eitherof matter or of mind, a power interrupting the fixed laws whichgovern their movements, a supernatural power.<br><br>\"The suspension or violation of the laws of nature involved inmiracles is nothing more than is constantly taking place aroundus. One force counteracts another: vital force keeps thechemical laws of matter in abeyance; and muscular force cancontrol the action of physical force. When a man raises a weightfrom the ground, the law of gravity is neither suspended norviolated, but counteracted by a stronger force. The same is trueas to the walking of Christ on the water and the swimming ofiron at the command of the prophet. The simple and grand truththat the universe is not under the exclusive control of physicalforces, but that everywhere and always there is above, separatefrom and superior to all else, an infinite personal will, notsuperseding, but directing and controlling all physical causes,acting with or without them.\" God ordinarily effects his purposethrough the agency of second causes; but he has the power alsoof effecting his purpose immediately and without theintervention of second causes, i.e., of invading the fixedorder, and thus of working miracles. Thus we affirm thepossibility of miracles, the possibility of a higher handintervening to control or reverse nature\'s ordinary movements.<br><br>In the New Testament these four Greek words are principally usedto designate miracles: (1.) Semeion, a \"sign\", i.e., an evidenceof a divine commission; an attestation of a divine message(Matt. 12:38, 39; 16:1, 4; Mark 8:11; Luke 11:16; 23:8; John2:11, 18, 23; Acts 6:8, etc.); a token of the presence andworking of God; the seal of a higher power.<br><br>(2.) Terata, \"wonders;\" wonder-causing events; portents;producing astonishment in the beholder (Acts 2:19).<br><br>(3.) Dunameis, \"might works;\" works of superhuman power (Acts2:22; Rom. 15:19; 2 Thess. 2:9); of a new and higher power.<br><br>(4.) Erga, \"works;\" the works of Him who is \"wonderful inworking\" (John 5:20, 36).<br><br>Miracles are seals of a divine mission. The sacred writersappealed to them as proofs that they were messengers of God. OurLord also appealed to miracles as a conclusive proof of hisdivine mission (John 5:20, 36; 10:25, 38). Thus, being out ofthe common course of nature and beyond the power of man, theyare fitted to convey the impression of the presence and power ofGod. Where miracles are there certainly God is. The man,therefore, who works a miracle affords thereby clear proof thathe comes with the authority of God; they are his credentialsthat he is God\'s messenger. The teacher points to thesecredentials, and they are a proof that he speaks with theauthority of God. He boldly says, \"God bears me witness, bothwith signs and wonders, and with divers miracles.\"<br><br>The credibility of miracles is established by the evidence ofthe senses on the part of those who are witnesses of them, andto all others by the testimony of such witnesses. The witnesseswere competent, and their testimony is trustworthy. Unbelievers,following Hume, deny that any testimony can prove a miracle,because they say miracles are impossible. We have shown thatmiracles are possible, and surely they can be borne witness to.Surely they are credible when we have abundant and trustworthyevidence of their occurrence. They are credible just as anyfacts of history well authenticated are credible. Miracles, itis said, are contrary to experience. Of course they are contraryto our experience, but that does not prove that they werecontrary to the experience of those who witnessed them. Webelieve a thousand facts, both of history and of science, thatare contrary to our experience, but we believe them on theground of competent testimony. An atheist or a pantheist must,as a matter of course, deny the possibility of miracles; but toone who believes in a personal God, who in his wisdom may seefit to interfere with the ordinary processes of nature, miraclesare not impossible, nor are they incredible.

This immigration took place probably about 350years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries before Joseph,Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral Semitic race from Asia,the Hyksos, who brought into cruel subjection the nativeEgyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his retinue wereaccustomed to a shepherd\'s life, and on their arrival in Egyptwere received with favour by the king, who assigned them the\"best of the land\", the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksosor \"shepherd\" king who thus showed favour to Joseph and hisfamily was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis).<br><br>Thus favoured, the Israelites began to \"multiply exceedingly\"(Gen. 47:27), and extended to the west and south. At length thesupremacy of the Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacobwere allowed to retain their possession of Goshen undisturbed,but after the death of Joseph their position was not sofavourable. The Egyptians began to despise them, and the periodof their \"affliction\" (Gen. 15:13) commenced. They were sorelyoppressed. They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and\"the land was filled with them\" (Ex. 1:7). The native Egyptiansregarded them with suspicion, so that they felt all the hardshipof a struggle for existence.<br><br>In process of time \"a king [probably Seti I.] arose who knew notJoseph\" (Ex. 1:8). (See [419]PHARAOH.) The circumstances of thecountry were such that this king thought it necessary to weakenhis Israelite subjects by oppressing them, and by degreesreducing their number. They were accordingly made public slaves,and were employed in connection with his numerous buildings,especially in the erection of store-cities, temples, andpalaces. The children of Israel were made to serve with rigour.Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and \"all theirservice, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour\" (Ex.1:13, 14). But this cruel oppression had not the result expectedof reducing their number. On the contrary, \"the more theEgyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew\"(Ex. 1:12).<br><br>The king next tried, through a compact secretly made with theguild of midwives, to bring about the destruction of all theHebrew male children that might be born. But the king\'s wish wasnot rigorously enforced; the male children were spared by themidwives, so that \"the people multiplied\" more than ever. Thusbaffled, the king issued a public proclamation calling on thepeople to put to death all the Hebrew male children by castingthem into the river (Ex. 1:22). But neither by this edict wasthe king\'s purpose effected.<br><br>One of the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of theking brought great alarm was that of Amram, of the family of theKohathites (Ex. 6:16-20), who with his wife Jochebed and twochildren, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen years of age, andAaron, a boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, thecapital city of that time. In this quiet home a male child wasborn (B.C. 1571). His mother concealed him in the house forthree months from the knowledge of the civic authorities. Butwhen the task of concealment became difficult, Jochebedcontrived to bring her child under the notice of the daughter ofthe king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which shelaid among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at thespot where the princess was wont to come down and bathe. Herplan was successful. The king\'s daughter \"saw the child; andbehold the child wept.\" The princess (see [420]PHARAOH\'SDAUGHTER [1]) sent Miriam, who was standing by, to fetch anurse. She went and brought the mother of the child, to whom theprincess said, \"Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and Iwill give thee thy wages.\" Thus Jochebed\'s child, whom theprincess called \"Moses\", i.e., \"Saved from the water\" (Ex.2:10), was ultimately restored to her.<br><br>As soon as the natural time for weaning the child had come, hewas transferred from the humble abode of his father to the royalpalace, where he was brought up as the adopted son of theprincess, his mother probably accompanying him and caring stillfor him. He grew up amid all the grandeur and excitement of theEgyptian court, maintaining, however, probably a constantfellowship with his mother, which was of the highest importanceas to his religious belief and his interest in his \"brethren.\"His education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and hewould enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his bodyand his mind. He at length became \"learned in all the wisdom ofthe Egyptians\" (Acts 7:22). Egypt had then two chief seats oflearning, or universities, at one of which, probably that ofHeliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now abouttwenty years of age, spent over twenty more before he came intoprominence in Bible history. These twenty years were probablyspent in military service. There is a tradition recorded byJosephus that he took a lead in the war which was then wagedbetween Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as askilful general, and became \"mighty in deeds\" (Acts 7:22).<br><br>After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses returned tothe Egyptian court, where he might reasonably have expected tobe loaded with honours and enriched with wealth. But \"beneaththe smooth current of his life hitherto, a life of alternateluxury at the court and comparative hardness in the camp and inthe discharge of his military duties, there had lurked fromchildhood to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secretdiscontent, perhaps a secret ambition. Moses, amid all hisEgyptian surroundings, had never forgotten, had never wished toforget, that he was a Hebrew.\" He now resolved to make himselfacquainted with the condition of his countrymen, and \"went outunto his brethren, and looked upon their burdens\" (Ex. 2:11).This tour of inspection revealed to him the cruel oppression andbondage under which they everywhere groaned, and could not failto press on him the serious consideration of his duty regardingthem. The time had arrived for his making common cause withthem, that he might thereby help to break their yoke of bondage.He made his choice accordingly (Heb. 11:25-27), assured that Godwould bless his resolution for the welfare of his people. He nowleft the palace of the king and took up his abode, probably inhis father\'s house, as one of the Hebrew people who had forforty years been suffering cruel wrong at the hands of theEgyptians.<br><br>He could not remain indifferent to the state of things aroundhim, and going out one day among the people, his indignation wasroused against an Egyptian who was maltreating a Hebrew. Herashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and hid hisbody in the sand. Next day he went out again and found twoHebrews striving together. He speedily found that the deed ofthe previous day was known. It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the\"great Rameses,\" Rameses II.), who \"sought to slay Moses\" (Ex.2:15). Moved by fear, Moses fled from Egypt, and betook himselfto the land of Midian, the southern part of the peninsula ofSinai, probably by much the same route as that by which, fortyyears afterwards, he led the Israelites to Sinai. He wasprovidentially led to find a new home with the family of Reuel,where he remained for forty years (Acts 7:30), under trainingunconsciously for his great life\'s work.<br><br>Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the burningbush (Ex. 3), and commissioned him to go down to Egypt and\"bring forth the children of Israel\" out of bondage. He was atfirst unwilling to go, but at length he was obedient to theheavenly vision, and left the land of Midian (4:18-26). On theway he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31).He and Aaron had a hard task before them; but the Lord was withthem (ch. 7-12), and the ransomed host went forth in triumph.(See [421]EXODUS.) After an eventful journey to and fro in thewilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains ofMoab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land.There Moses addressed the assembled elders (Deut. 1:1-4;5:1-26:19; 27:11-30:20), and gives the people his last counsels,and then rehearses the great song (Deut. 32), clothing infitting words the deep emotions of his heart at such a time, andin review of such a marvellous history as that in which he hadacted so conspicious a part. Then, after blessing the tribes(33), he ascends to \"the mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top ofPisgah, that is over against Jericho\" (34:1), and from thence hesurveys the land. \"Jehovah shewed him all the land of Gilead,unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, andManasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, andthe south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city ofpalm trees, unto Zoar\" (Deut. 34:2-3), the magnificientinheritance of the tribes of whom he had been so long theleader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty yearsold, according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by theLord \"in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor\"(34:6). The people mourned for him during thirty days.<br><br>Thus died \"Moses the man of God\" (Deut. 33:1; Josh. 14:6).

But there seems to be no sufficient reason for thesesuppositions. The Jews believed that, according to Micah 5:2,the birth of the Messiah would take place at Bethlehem, andnowhere else. Nathanael held the same opinion as his countrymen,and believed that the great \"good\" which they were all expectingcould not come from Nazareth. This is probably what Nathanaelmeant.

After these sacrifices were offered by thepriest, the Nazarite cut off his hair at the door and threw itinto the fire under the peace-offering.<br><br>For some reason, probably in the midst of his work at Corinth,Paul took on himself the Nazarite vow. This could only beterminated by his going up to Jerusalem to offer up the hairwhich till then was to be left uncut. But it seems to have beenallowable for persons at a distance to cut the hair, which wasto be brought up to Jerusalem, where the ceremony was completed.This Paul did at Cenchrea just before setting out on his voyageinto Syria (Acts 18:18).<br><br>On another occasion (Acts 21:23-26), at the feast of Pentecost,Paul took on himself again the Nazarite vow. \"The ceremoniesinvolved took a longer time than Paul had at his disposal, butthe law permitted a man to share the vow if he could findcompanions who had gone through the prescribed ceremonies, andwho permitted him to join their company. This permission wascommonly granted if the new comer paid all the fees requiredfrom the whole company (fee to the Levite for cutting the hairand fees for sacrifices), and finished the vow along with theothers. Four Jewish Christians were performing the vow, andwould admit Paul to their company, provided he paid theirexpenses. Paul consented, paid the charges, and when the lastseven days of the vow began he went with them to live in thetemple, giving the usual notice to the priests that he hadjoined in regular fashion, was a sharer with the four men, andthat his vow would end with theirs. Nazarites retired to thetemple during the last period of seven days, because they couldbe secure there against any accidental defilement\" (Lindsay\'sActs).<br><br>As to the duration of a Nazarite\'s vow, every one was left atliberty to fix his own time. There is mention made in Scriptureof only three who were Nazarites for life, Samson, Samuel, andJohn the Baptist (Judg. 13:4, 5; 1 Sam. 1:11; Luke 1:15). In itsordinary form, however, the Nazarite\'s vow lasted only thirty,and at most one hundred, days.

The Egyptians met himat Carchemish, where a furious battle was fought, resulting inthe complete rout of the Egyptians, who were driven back (Jer.46:2-12), and Syria and Phoenicia brought under the sway ofBabylon (B.C. 606).

For manydays he fasted and mourned and prayed for the place of hisfathers\' sepulchres. At length the king observed his sadness ofcountenance and asked the reason of it.

The Assyrian empire then came to an end, theMedes and Babylonians dividing its provinces between them.\"After having ruled for more than six hundred years with hideoustyranny and violence, from the Caucasus and the Caspian to thePersian Gulf, and from beyond the Tigris to Asia Minor andEgypt, it vanished like a dream\" (Nah. 2:6-11).

Vaguememories had indeed survived of its power and greatness, butvery little was definitely known about it. Other cities whichhad perished, as Palmyra, Persepolis, and Thebes, had left ruinsto mark their sites and tell of their former greatness; but ofthis city, imperial Nineveh, not a single vestige seemed toremain, and the very place on which it had stood was only matterof conjecture.

He is thesecond great progenitor of the human family.<br><br>The words of his father Lamech at his birth (Gen. 5:29) havebeen regarded as in a sense prophetical, designating Noah as atype of Him who is the true \"rest and comfort\" of men under theburden of life (Matt. 11:28).<br><br>He lived five hundred years, and then there were born unto himthree sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth (Gen. 5:32). He was a \"justman and perfect in his generation,\" and \"walked with God\" (comp.Ezek. 14:14, 20). But now the descendants of Cain and of Sethbegan to intermarry, and then there sprang up a racedistinguished for their ungodliness. Men became more and morecorrupt, and God determined to sweep the earth of its wickedpopulation (Gen. 6:7). But with Noah God entered into acovenant, with a promise of deliverance from the threateneddeluge (18). He was accordingly commanded to build an ark(6:14-16) for the saving of himself and his house. An intervalof one hundred and twenty years elapsed while the ark was beingbuilt (6:3), during which Noah bore constant testimony againstthe unbelief and wickedness of that generation (1 Pet. 3:18-20;2 Pet. 2:5).<br><br>When the ark of \"gopher-wood\" (mentioned only here) was atlength completed according to the command of the Lord, theliving creatures that were to be preserved entered into it; andthen Noah and his wife and sons and daughters-in-law entered it,and the \"Lord shut him in\" (Gen. 7:16). The judgment-threatenednow fell on the guilty world, \"the world that then was, beingoverflowed with water, perished\" (2 Pet. 3:6). The ark floatedon the waters for one hundred and fifty days, and then rested onthe mountains of Ararat (Gen. 8:3, 4); but not for aconsiderable time after this was divine permission given him toleave the ark, so that he and his family were a whole year shutup within it (Gen. 6-14).<br><br>On leaving the ark Noah\'s first act was to erect an altar, thefirst of which there is any mention, and offer the sacrifices ofadoring thanks and praise to God, who entered into a covenantwith him, the first covenant between God and man, granting himpossession of the earth by a new and special charter, whichremains in force to the present time (Gen. 8:21-9:17). As a signand witness of this covenant, the rainbow was adopted and setapart by God, as a sure pledge that never again would the earthbe destroyed by a flood.<br><br>But, alas! Noah after this fell into grievous sin (Gen. 9:21);and the conduct of Ham on this sad occasion led to the memorableprediction regarding his three sons and their descendants. Noah\"lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years, and hedied\" (28:29). (See [443]DELUGE).<br><br>Noah, motion, (Heb.

The road from Jerusalem to Bethany runs as of old overthis mount. It was on this mount that Jesus stood when he weptover Jerusalem. \"No name in Scripture,\" says Dr. Porter, \"callsup associations at once so sacred and so pleasing as that ofOlivet. The mount\' is so intimately connected with the private,the devotional life of the Saviour, that we read of it and lookat it with feelings of deepest interest and affection. Here heoften sat with his disciples, telling them of wondrous eventsyet to come, of the destruction of the Holy City; of thesufferings, the persecution, and the final triumph of hisfollowers (Matt. 24). Here he gave them the beautiful parablesof the ten virgins and the five talents (25); here he was wontto retire on each evening for meditation, and prayer, and restof body, when weary and harassed by the labours and trials ofthe day (Luke 21:37); and here he came on the night of hisbetrayal to utter that wonderful prayer, O my Father, if it bepossible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will,but as thou wilt\' (Matt. 26:39). And when the cup of God\'s wrathhad been drunk, and death and the grave conquered, he led hisdisciples out again over Olivet as far as to Bethany, and aftera parting blessing ascended to heaven (Luke 24:50, 51; Acts1:12).\"<br><br>This mount, or rather mountain range, has four summits or peaks:(1) the \"Galilee\" peak, so called from a tradition that theangels stood here when they spoke to the disciples (Acts 1:11);(2) the \"Mount of Ascension,\" the supposed site of that event,which was, however, somewhere probably nearer Bethany (Luke24:51, 52); (3) the \"Prophets,\" from the catacombs on its side,called \"the prophets\' tombs;\" and (4) the \"Mount of Corruption,\"so called because of the \"high places\" erected there by Solomonfor the idolatrous worship of his foreign wives (1 Kings 11:7; 2Kings 23:13; Vulg., \"Mount of Offence\").<br><br>'),

It has fittingly been designated \"the leastof all lands.\" Western Palestine, on the south of Gaza, is onlyabout 40 miles in breadth from the Mediterranean to the DeadSea, narrowing gradually toward the north, where it is only 20miles from the sea-coast to the Jordan.<br><br>Palestine, \"set in the midst\" (Ezek. 5:5) of all other lands, isthe most remarkable country on the face of the earth. No singlecountry of such an extent has so great a variety of climate, andhence also of plant and animal life. Moses describes it as \"agood land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depthsthat spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, andbarley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land ofoil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt not eat breadwithout scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a landwhose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest digbrass\" (Deut. 8:7-9).<br><br>\"In the time of Christ the country looked, in all probability,much as now. The whole land consists of rounded limestone hills,fretted into countless stony valleys, offering but rarely leveltracts, of which Esdraelon alone, below Nazareth, is largeenough to be seen on the map. The original woods had for agesdisappeared, though the slopes were dotted, as now, with figs,olives, and other fruit-trees where there was any soil.Permanent streams were even then unknown, the passing rush ofwinter torrents being all that was seen among the hills. Theautumn and spring rains, caught in deep cisterns hewn out likehuge underground jars in the soft limestone, with artificialmud-banked ponds still found near all villages, furnished water.Hills now bare, or at best rough with stunted growth, were thenterraced, so as to grow vines, olives, and grain. To-day almostdesolate, the country then teemed with population. Wine-pressescut in the rocks, endless terraces, and the ruins of oldvineyard towers are now found amidst solitudes overgrown forages with thorns and thistles, or with wild shrubs and poorgnarled scrub\" (Geikie\'s Life of Christ).<br><br>From an early period the land was inhabited by the descendantsof Canaan, who retained possession of the whole land \"from Sidonto Gaza\" till the time of the conquest by Joshua, when it wasoccupied by the twelve tribes. Two tribes and a half had theirallotments given them by Moses on the east of the Jordan (Deut.3:12-20; comp. Num. 1:17-46; Josh. 4:12-13). The remainingtribes had their portion on the west of Jordan.<br><br>From the conquest till the time of Saul, about four hundredyears, the people were governed by judges. For a period of onehundred and twenty years the kingdom retained its unity while itwas ruled by Saul and David and Solomon. On the death ofSolomon, his son Rehoboam ascended the throne; but his conductwas such that ten of the tribes revolted, and formed anindependent monarchy, called the kingdom of Israel, or thenorthern kingdom, the capital of which was first Shechem andafterwards Samaria. This kingdom was destroyed. The Israeliteswere carried captive by Shalmanezer, king of Assyria, B.C. 722,after an independent existence of two hundred and fifty-threeyears. The place of the captives carried away was supplied bytribes brought from the east, and thus was formed the Samaritannation (2 Kings 17:24-29).<br><br>Nebuchadnezzar came up against the kingdom of the two tribes,the kingdom of Judah, the capital of which was Jerusalem, onehundred and thirty-four years after the overthrow of the kingdomof Israel. He overthrew the city, plundered the temple, andcarried the people into captivity to Babylon (B.C. 587), wherethey remained seventy years. At the close of the period of theCaptivity, they returned to their own land, under the edict ofCyrus (Ezra 1:1-4). They rebuilt the city and temple, andrestored the old Jewish commonwealth.<br><br>For a while after the Restoration the Jews were ruled byZerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and afterwards by the highpriests, assisted by the Sanhedrin. After the death of Alexanderthe Great at Babylon (B.C. 323), his vast empire was dividedbetween his four generals. Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, andCoele-Syria fell to the lot of Ptolemy Lagus. Ptolemy tookpossession of Palestine in B.C. 320, and carried nearly onehundred thousand of the inhabitants of Jerusalem into Egypt. Hemade Alexandria the capital of his kingdom, and treated the Jewswith consideration, confirming them in the enjoyment of manyprivileges.<br><br>After suffering persecution at the hands of Ptolemy\'ssuccessors, the Jews threw off the Egyptian yoke, and becamesubject to Antiochus the Great, the king of Syria. The crueltyand opression of the successors of Antiochus at length led tothe revolt under the Maccabees (B.C. 163), when they threw offthe Syrian yoke.<br><br>In the year B.C. 68, Palestine was reduced by Pompey the Greatto a Roman province. He laid the walls of the city in ruins, andmassacred some twelve thousand of the inhabitants. He left thetemple, however, unijured. About twenty-five years after thisthe Jews revolted and cast off the Roman yoke. They werehowever, subdued by Herod the Great (q.v.). The city and thetemple were destroyed, and many of the inhabitants were put todeath. About B.C. 20, Herod proceeded to rebuild the city andrestore the ruined temple, which in about nine years and a halfwas so far completed that the sacred services could be resumedin it (comp. John 2:20). He was succeeded by his son Archelaus,who was deprived of his power, however, by Augustus, A.D. 6,when Palestine became a Roman province, ruled by Roman governorsor procurators. Pontius Pilate was the fifth of theseprocurators. He was appointed to his office A.D. 25.<br><br>Exclusive of Idumea, the kingdom of Herod the Great comprehendedthe whole of the country originally divided among the twelvetribes, which he divided into four provinces or districts. Thisdivision was recognized so long as Palestine was under the Romandominion. These four provinces were, (1) Judea, the southernportion of the country; (2) Samaria, the middle province, thenorthern boundary of which ran along the hills to the south ofthe plain of Esdraelon; (3) Galilee, the northern province; and(4) Peraea (a Greek name meaning the \"opposite country\"), thecountry lying east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea. This provincewas subdivided into these districts, (1) Peraea proper, lyingbetween the rivers Arnon and Jabbok; (2) Galaaditis (Gilead);(3) Batanaea; (4) Gaulonitis (Jaulan); (5) Ituraea or Auranitis,the ancient Bashan; (6) Trachonitis; (7) Abilene; (8) Decapolis,i.e., the region of the ten cities. The whole territory ofPalestine, including the portions alloted to the trans-Jordantribes, extended to about eleven thousand square miles. Recentexploration has shown the territory on the west of Jordan aloneto be six thousand square miles in extent, the size of theprincipality of Wales.<br><br>'),

(2871, 'Paul', '=Saul (q.v.) was born about the same time as our Lord. Hiscircumcision-name was Saul, and probably the name Paul was alsogiven to him in infancy \"for use in the Gentile world,\" as\"Saul\" would be his Hebrew home-name. He was a native of Tarsus,the capital of Cilicia, a Roman province in the south-east ofAsia Minor. That city stood on the banks of the river Cydnus,which was navigable thus far; hence it became a centre ofextensive commercial traffic with many countries along theshores of the Mediterranean, as well as with the countries ofcentral Asia Minor. It thus became a city distinguished for thewealth of its inhabitants.<br><br>Tarsus was also the seat of a famous university, higher inreputation even than the universities of Athens and Alexandria,the only others that then existed. Here Saul was born, and herehe spent his youth, doubtless enjoying the best education hisnative city could afford. His father was of the straitest sectof the Jews, a Pharisee, of the tribe of Benjamin, of pure andunmixed Jewish blood (Acts 23:6; Phil. 3:5). We learn nothingregarding his mother; but there is reason to conclude that shewas a pious woman, and that, like-minded with her husband, sheexercised all a mother influence in moulding the character ofher son, so that he could afterwards speak of himself as being,from his youth up, \"touching the righteousness which is in thelaw, blameless\" (Phil. 3:6).<br><br>We read of his sister and his sister\'s son (Acts 23:16), and ofother relatives (Rom. 16:7, 11, 12). Though a Jew, his fatherwas a Roman citizen. How he obtained this privilege we are notinformed. \"It might be bought, or won by distinguished serviceto the state, or acquired in several other ways; at all events,his son was freeborn. It was a valuable privilege, and one thatwas to prove of great use to Paul, although not in the way inwhich his father might have been expected to desire him to makeuse of it.\" Perhaps the most natural career for the youth tofollow was that of a merchant. \"But it was decided that...heshould go to college and become a rabbi, that is, a minister, ateacher, and a lawyer all in one.\"<br><br>According to Jewish custom, however, he learned a trade beforeentering on the more direct preparation for the sacredprofession. The trade he acquired was the making of tents fromgoats\' hair cloth, a trade which was one of the commonest inTarsus.<br><br>His preliminary education having been completed, Saul was sent,when about thirteen years of age probably, to the great Jewishschool of sacred learning at Jerusalem as a student of the law.Here he became a pupil of the celebrated rabbi Gamaliel, andhere he spent many years in an elaborate study of the Scripturesand of the many questions concerning them with which the rabbisexercised themselves. During these years of diligent study helived \"in all good conscience,\" unstained by the vices of thatgreat city.<br><br>After the period of his student-life expired, he probably leftJerusalem for Tarsus, where he may have been engaged inconnection with some synagogue for some years. But we find himback again at Jerusalem very soon after the death of our Lord.Here he now learned the particulars regarding the crucifixion,and the rise of the new sect of the \"Nazarenes.\"<br><br>For some two years after Pentecost, Christianity was quietlyspreading its influence in Jerusalem. At length Stephen, one ofthe seven deacons, gave forth more public and aggressivetestimony that Jesus was the Messiah, and this led to muchexcitement among the Jews and much disputation in theirsynagogues. Persecution arose against Stephen and the followersof Christ generally, in which Saul of Tarsus took a prominentpart. He was at this time probably a member of the greatSanhedrin, and became the active leader in the furiouspersecution by which the rulers then sought to exterminateChristianity.<br><br>But the object of this persecution also failed. \"They that werescattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.\" The angerof the persecutor was thereby kindled into a fiercer flame.Hearing that fugitives had taken refuge in Damascus, he obtainedfrom the chief priest letters authorizing him to proceed thitheron his persecuting career. This was a long journey of about 130miles, which would occupy perhaps six days, during which, withhis few attendants, he steadily went onward, \"breathing outthreatenings and slaughter.\" But the crisis of his life was athand. He had reached the last stage of his journey, and waswithin sight of Damascus. As he and his companions rode on,suddenly at mid-day a brilliant light shone round them, and Saulwas laid prostrate in terror on the ground, a voice sounding inhis ears, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\" The risenSaviour was there, clothed in the vesture of his glorifiedhumanity. In answer to the anxious inquiry of the strickenpersecutor, \"Who art thou, Lord?\" he said, \"I am Jesus whom thoupersecutest\" (Acts 9:5; 22:8; 26:15).<br><br>This was the moment of his conversion, the most solemn in allhis life. Blinded by the dazzling light (Acts 9:8), hiscompanions led him into the city, where, absorbed in deepthought for three days, he neither ate nor drank (9:11).Ananias, a disciple living in Damascus, was informed by a visionof the change that had happened to Saul, and was sent to him toopen his eyes and admit him by baptism into the Christian church(9:11-16). The whole purpose of his life was now permanentlychanged.<br><br>Immediately after his conversion he retired into the solitudesof Arabia (Gal. 1:17), perhaps of \"Sinai in Arabia,\" for thepurpose, probably, of devout study and meditation on themarvellous revelation that had been made to him. \"A veil ofthick darkness hangs over this visit to Arabia. Of the scenesamong which he moved, of the thoughts and occupations whichengaged him while there, of all the circumstances of a crisiswhich must have shaped the whole tenor of his after-life,absolutely nothing is known. Immediately,\' says St. Paul, I wentaway into Arabia.\' The historian passes over the incident [comp.Acts 9:23 and 1 Kings 11:38, 39]. It is a mysterious pause, amoment of suspense, in the apostle\'s history, a breathless calm,which ushers in the tumultuous storm of his active missionarylife.\" Coming back, after three years, to Damascus, he began topreach the gospel \"boldly in the name of Jesus\" (Acts 9:27), butwas soon obliged to flee (9:25; 2 Cor. 11:33) from the Jews andbetake himself to Jerusalem. Here he tarried for three weeks,but was again forced to flee (Acts 9:28, 29) from persecution.He now returned to his native Tarsus (Gal. 1:21), where, forprobably about three years, we lose sight of him. The time hadnot yet come for his entering on his great life-work ofpreaching the gospel to the Gentiles.<br><br>At length the city of Antioch, the capital of Syria, became thescene of great Christian activity. There the gospel gained afirm footing, and the cause of Christ prospered. Barnabas(q.v.), who had been sent from Jerusalem to superintend the workat Antioch, found it too much for him, and remembering Saul, heset out to Tarsus to seek for him. He readily responded to thecall thus addressed to him, and came down to Antioch, which for\"a whole year\" became the scene of his labours, which werecrowned with great success. The disciples now, for the firsttime, were called \"Christians\" (Acts 11:26).<br><br>The church at Antioch now proposed to send out missionaries tothe Gentiles, and Saul and Barnabas, with John Mark as theirattendant, were chosen for this work. This was a great epoch inthe history of the church. Now the disciples began to giveeffect to the Master\'s command: \"Go ye into all the world, andpreach the gospel to every creature.\"<br><br>The three missionaries went forth on the first missionary tour.They sailed from Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch, across toCyprus, some 80 miles to the south-west. Here at Paphos, SergiusPaulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted, and now Saul tookthe lead, and was ever afterwards called Paul. The missionariesnow crossed to the mainland, and then proceeded 6 or 7 miles upthe river Cestrus to Perga (Acts 13:13), where John Markdeserted the work and returned to Jerusalem. The two thenproceeded about 100 miles inland, passing through Pamphylia,Pisidia, and Lycaonia. The towns mentioned in this tour are thePisidian Antioch, where Paul delivered his first address ofwhich we have any record (13:16-51; comp. 10:30-43), Iconium,Lystra, and Derbe. They returned by the same route to see andencourage the converts they had made, and ordain elders in everycity to watch over the churches which had been gathered. FromPerga they sailed direct for Antioch, from which they had setout.<br><br>After remaining \"a long time\", probably till A.D. 50 or 51, inAntioch, a great controversy broke out in the church thereregarding the relation of the Gentiles to the Mosaic law. Forthe purpose of obtaining a settlement of this question, Paul andBarnabas were sent as deputies to consult the church atJerusalem. The council or synod which was there held (Acts 15)decided against the Judaizing party; and the deputies,accompanied by Judas and Silas, returned to Antioch, bringingwith them the decree of the council.<br><br>After a short rest at Antioch, Paul said to Barnabas: \"Let us goagain and visit our brethren in every city where we havepreached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.\" Markproposed again to accompany them; but Paul refused to allow himto go. Barnabas was resolved to take Mark, and thus he and Paulhad a sharp contention. They separated, and never again met.Paul, however, afterwards speaks with honour of Barnabas, andsends for Mark to come to him at Rome (Col. 4:10; 2 Tim. 4:11).<br><br>Paul took with him Silas, instead of Barnabas, and began hissecond missionary journey about A.D. 51. This time he went byland, revisiting the churches he had already founded in Asia.But he longed to enter into \"regions beyond,\" and still wentforward through Phrygia and Galatia (16:6). Contrary to hisintention, he was constrained to linger in Galatia (q.v.), onaccount of some bodily affliction (Gal. 4:13, 14). Bithynia, apopulous province on the shore of the Black Sea, lay now beforehim, and he wished to enter it; but the way was shut, the Spiritin some manner guiding him in another direction, till he camedown to the shores of the AEgean and arrived at Troas, on thenorth-western coast of Asia Minor (Acts 16:8). Of this longjourney from Antioch to Troas we have no account except somereferences to it in his Epistle to the Galatians (4:13).<br><br>As he waited at Troas for indications of the will of God as tohis future movements, he saw, in the vision of the night, a manfrom the opposite shores of Macedonia standing before him, andheard him cry, \"Come over, and help us\" (Acts 16:9). Paulrecognized in this vision a message from the Lord, and the verynext day set sail across the Hellespont, which separated himfrom Europe, and carried the tidings of the gospel into theWestern world. In Macedonia, churches were planted in Philippi,Thessalonica, and Berea. Leaving this province, Paul passed intoAchaia, \"the paradise of genius and renown.\" He reached Athens,but quitted it after, probably, a brief sojourn (17:17-31). TheAthenians had received him with cold disdain, and he nevervisited that city again. He passed over to Corinth, the seat ofthe Roman government of Achaia, and remained there a year and ahalf, labouring with much success. While at Corinth, he wrotehis two epistles to the church of Thessalonica, his earliestapostolic letters, and then sailed for Syria, that he might bein time to keep the feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem. He wasaccompanied by Aquila and Priscilla, whom he left at Ephesus, atwhich he touched, after a voyage of thirteen or fifteen days. Helanded at Caesarea, and went up to Jerusalem, and having\"saluted the church\" there, and kept the feast, he left forAntioch, where he abode \"some time\" (Acts 18:20-23).<br><br>He then began his third missionary tour. He journeyed by land inthe \"upper coasts\" (the more eastern parts) of Asia Minor, andat length made his way to Ephesus, where he tarried for no lessthan three years, engaged in ceaseless Christian labour. \"Thiscity was at the time the Liverpool of the Mediterranean. Itpossessed a splendid harbour, in which was concentrated thetraffic of the sea which was then the highway of the nations;and as Liverpool has behind her the great towns of Lancashire,so had Ephesus behind and around her such cities as thosementioned along with her in the epistles to the churches in thebook of Revelation, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis,Philadelphia, and Laodicea. It was a city of vast wealth, and itwas given over to every kind of pleasure, the fame of itstheatres and race-course being world-wide\" (Stalker\'s Life ofSt. Paul). Here a \"great door and effectual\" was opened to theapostle. His fellow-labourers aided him in his work, carryingthe gospel to Colosse and Laodicea and other places which theycould reach.<br><br>Very shortly before his departure from Ephesus, the apostlewrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians (q.v.). Thesilversmiths, whose traffic in the little images which they madewas in danger (see [461]DEMETRIUS), organized a riot againstPaul, and he left the city, and proceeded to Troas (2 Cor.2:12), whence after some time he went to meet Titus inMacedonia. Here, in consequence of the report Titus brought fromCorinth, he wrote his second epistle to that church. Havingspent probably most of the summer and autumn in Macedonia,visiting the churches there, specially the churches of Philippi,Thessalonica, and Berea, probably penetrating into the interior,to the shores of the Adriatic (Rom. 15:19), he then came intoGreece, where he abode three month, spending probably thegreater part of this time in Corinth (Acts 20:2). During hisstay in this city he wrote his Epistle to the Galatians, andalso the great Epistle to the Romans. At the end of the threemonths he left Achaia for Macedonia, thence crossed into AsiaMinor, and touching at Miletus, there addressed the Ephesianpresbyters, whom he had sent for to meet him (Acts 20:17), andthen sailed for Tyre, finally reaching Jerusalem, probably inthe spring of A.D. 58.<br><br>While at Jerusalem, at the feast of Pentecost, he was almostmurdered by a Jewish mob in the temple. (See [462]TEMPLE,HEROD\'S.) Rescued from their violence by the Roman commandant,he was conveyed as a prisoner to Caesarea, where, from variouscauses, he was detained a prisoner for two years in Herod\'spraetorium (Acts 23:35). \"Paul was not kept in closeconfinement; he had at least the range of the barracks in whichhe was detained. There we can imagine him pacing the ramparts onthe edge of the Mediterranean, and gazing wistfully across theblue waters in the direction of Macedonia, Achaia, and Ephesus,where his spiritual children were pining for him, or perhapsencountering dangers in which they sorely needed his presence.It was a mysterious providence which thus arrested his energiesand condemned the ardent worker to inactivity; yet we can nowsee the reason for it. Paul was needing rest. After twenty yearsof incessant evangelization, he required leisure to garner theharvest of experience...During these two years he wrote nothing;it was a time of internal mental activity and silent progress\"(Stalker\'s Life of St. Paul).<br><br>At the end of these two years Felix (q.v.) was succeeded in thegovernorship of Palestine by Porcius Festus, before whom theapostle was again heard. But judging it right at this crisis toclaim the privilege of a Roman citizen, he appealed to theemperor (Acts 25:11). Such an appeal could not be disregarded,and Paul was at once sent on to Rome under the charge of oneJulius, a centurion of the \"Augustan cohort.\" After a long andperilous voyage, he at length reached the imperial city in theearly spring, probably, of A.D. 61. Here he was permitted tooccupy his own hired house, under constant military custody.This privilege was accorded to him, no doubt, because he was aRoman citizen, and as such could not be put into prison withouta trial. The soldiers who kept guard over Paul were of coursechanged at frequent intervals, and thus he had the opportunityof preaching the gospel to many of them during these \"two wholeyears,\" and with the blessed result of spreading among theimperial guards, and even in Caesar\'s household, an interest inthe truth (Phil. 1:13). His rooms were resorted to by manyanxious inquirers, both Jews and Gentiles (Acts 28:23, 30, 31),and thus his imprisonment \"turned rather to the furtherance ofthe gospel,\" and his \"hired house\" became the centre of agracious influence which spread over the whole city. Accordingto a Jewish tradition, it was situated on the borders of themodern Ghetto, which has been the Jewish quarters in Rome fromthe time of Pompey to the present day. During this period theapostle wrote his epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians,Philippians, and to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews.<br><br>This first imprisonment came at length to a close, Paul havingbeen acquitted, probably because no witnesses appeared againsthim. Once more he set out on his missionary labours, probablyvisiting western and eastern Europe and Asia Minor. During thisperiod of freedom he wrote his First Epistle to Timothy and hisEpistle to Titus. The year of his release was signalized by theburning of Rome, which Nero saw fit to attribute to theChristians. A fierce persecution now broke out against theChristians. Paul was siezed, and once more conveyed to Rome aprisoner. During this imprisonment he probably wrote the SecondEpistle to Timothy, the last he ever wrote. \"There can be littledoubt that he appered again at Nero\'s bar, and this time thecharge did not break down. In all history there is not a morestartling illustration of the irony of human life than thisscene of Paul at the bar of Nero. On the judgment-seat, clad inthe imperial purple, sat a man who, in a bad world, had attainedthe eminence of being the very worst and meanest being in it, aman stained with every crime, a man whose whole being was sosteeped in every nameable and unnameable vice, that body andsoul of him were, as some one said at the time, nothing but acompound of mud and blood; and in the prisoner\'s dock stood thebest man the world possessed, his hair whitened with labours forthe good of men and the glory of God. The trial ended: Paul wascondemned, and delivered over to the executioner. He was led outof the city, with a crowd of the lowest rabble at his heels. Thefatal spot was reached; he knelt beside the block; theheadsman\'s axe gleamed in the sun and fell; and the head of theapostle of the world rolled down in the dust\" (probably A.D.66), four years before the fall of Jerusalem.<br><br>'),

As regards thePentateuch, they are not ashamed to attribute fraud, and evenconspiracy, to its authors, who sought to find acceptance totheir work which was composed partly in the age of Josiah, andpartly in that of Ezra and Nehemiah, by giving it out to be thework of Moses! This is not the place to enter into the detailsof this controversy. We may say frankly, however, that we haveno faith in this \"higher criticism.\" It degrades the books ofthe Old Testament below the level of fallible human writings,and the arguments on which its speculations are built arealtogether untenable.<br><br>The evidences in favour of the Mosaic authorship of thePentateuch are conclusive.

Our Lord plainly taught the Mosaic authorship of thesebooks (Matt. 5:17, 18; 19:8; 22:31, 32; 23:2; Mark 10:9; 12:26;Luke 16:31; 20:37; 24:26, 27, 44; John 3:14; 5:45, 46, 47; 6:32,49; 7:19, 22). In the face of this fact, will any one venture toallege either that Christ was ignorant of the composition of theBible, or that, knowing the true state of the case, he yetencouraged the people in the delusion they clung to?<br><br>(4.) From the time of Joshua down to the time of Ezra there is,in the intermediate historical books, a constant reference tothe Pentateuch as the \"Book of the Law of Moses.\" This is apoint of much importance, inasmuch as the critics deny thatthere is any such reference; and hence they deny the historicalcharacter of the Pentateuch. As regards the Passover, e.g., wefind it frequently spoken of or alluded to in the historicalbooks following the Pentateuch, showing that the \"Law of Moses\"was then certainly known. It was celebrated in the time ofJoshua (Josh. 5:10, cf. 4:19), Hezekiah (2 Chr. 30), Josiah (2Kings 23; 2 Chr. 35), and Zerubbabel (Ezra 6:19-22), and isreferred to in such passages as 2 Kings 23:22; 2 Chr. 35:18; 1Kings 9:25 (\"three times in a year\"); 2 Chr. 8:13. Similarly wemight show frequent references to the Feast of Tabernacles andother Jewish institutions, although we do not admit that anyvalid argument can be drawn from the silence of Scripture insuch a case. An examination of the following texts, 1 Kings 2:9;2 Kings 14:6; 2 Chr. 23:18; 25:4; 34:14; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Dan.9:11, 13, will also plainly show that the \"Law of Moses\" wasknown during all these centuries.<br><br>Granting that in the time of Moses there existed certain oraltraditions or written records and documents which he wasdivinely led to make use of in his history, and that his writingwas revised by inspired successors, this will fully account forcertain peculiarities of expression which critics have called\"anachronisms\" and \"contradictions,\" but in no way militatesagainst the doctrine that Moses was the original author of thewhole of the Pentateuch. It is not necessary for us to affirmthat the whole is an original composition; but we affirm thatthe evidences clearly demonstrate that Moses was the author ofthose books which have come down to us bearing his name. ThePentateuch is certainly the basis and necessary preliminary ofthe whole of the Old Testament history and literature. (See[465]DEUTERONOMY.)<br><br>'),

(2911, 'Peter', 'Originally called Simon (=Simeon, i.e., \"hearing\"), a verycommon Jewish name in the New Testament. He was the son of Jona(Matt. 16:17). His mother is nowhere named in Scripture. He hada younger brother called Andrew, who first brought him to Jesus(John 1:40-42). His native town was Bethsaida, on the westerncoast of the Sea of Galilee, to which also Philip belonged. Herehe was brought up by the shores of the Sea of Galilee, and wastrained to the occupation of a fisher. His father had probablydied while he was still young, and he and his brother werebrought up under the care of Zebedee and his wife Salome (Matt.27:56; Mark 15:40; 16:1). There the four youths, Simon, Andrew,James, and John, spent their boyhood and early manhood inconstant fellowship. Simon and his brother doubtless enjoyed allthe advantages of a religious training, and were earlyinstructed in an acquaintance with the Scriptures and with thegreat prophecies regarding the coming of the Messiah. They didnot probably enjoy, however, any special training in the studyof the law under any of the rabbis. When Peter appeared beforethe Sanhedrin, he looked like an \"unlearned man\" (Acts 4:13).<br><br>\"Simon was a Galilean, and he was that out and out...TheGalileans had a marked character of their own. They had areputation for an independence and energy which often ran outinto turbulence. They were at the same time of a franker andmore transparent disposition than their brethren in the south.In all these respects, in bluntness, impetuosity, headiness, andsimplicity, Simon was a genuine Galilean. They spoke a peculiardialect. They had a difficulty with the guttural sounds and someothers, and their pronunciation was reckoned harsh in Judea. TheGalilean accent stuck to Simon all through his career. Itbetrayed him as a follower of Christ when he stood within thejudgment-hall (Mark 14:70). It betrayed his own nationality andthat of those conjoined with him on the day of Pentecost (Acts2:7).\" It would seem that Simon was married before he became anapostle. His wife\'s mother is referred to (Matt. 8:14; Mark1:30; Luke 4:38). He was in all probability accompanied by hiswife on his missionary journeys (1 Cor. 9:5; comp. 1 Pet. 5:13).<br><br>He appears to have been settled at Capernaum when Christ enteredon his public ministry, and may have reached beyond the age ofthirty. His house was large enough to give a home to his brotherAndrew, his wife\'s mother, and also to Christ, who seems to havelived with him (Mark 1:29, 36; 2:1), as well as to his ownfamily. It was apparently two stories high (2:4).<br><br>At Bethabara (R.V., John 1:28, \"Bethany\"), beyond Jordan, Johnthe Baptist had borne testimony concerning Jesus as the \"Lamb ofGod\" (John 1:29-36). Andrew and John hearing it, followed Jesus,and abode with him where he was. They were convinced, by hisgracious words and by the authority with which he spoke, that hewas the Messiah (Luke 4:22; Matt. 7:29); and Andrew went forthand found Simon and brought him to Jesus (John 1:41).<br><br>Jesus at once recognized Simon, and declared that hereafter hewould be called Cephas, an Aramaic name corresponding to theGreek Petros, which means \"a mass of rock detached from theliving rock.\" The Aramaic name does not occur again, but thename Peter gradually displaces the old name Simon, though ourLord himself always uses the name Simon when addressing him(Matt. 17:25; Mark 14:37; Luke 22:31, comp. 21:15-17). We arenot told what impression the first interview with Jesus producedon the mind of Simon. When we next meet him it is by the Sea ofGalilee (Matt. 4:18-22). There the four (Simon and Andrew, Jamesand John) had had an unsuccessful night\'s fishing. Jesusappeared suddenly, and entering into Simon\'s boat, bade himlaunch forth and let down the nets. He did so, and enclosed agreat multitude of fishes. This was plainly a miracle wroughtbefore Simon\'s eyes. The awe-stricken disciple cast himself atthe feet of Jesus, crying, \"Depart from me; for I am a sinfulman, O Lord\" (Luke 5:8). Jesus addressed him with the assuringwords, \"Fear not,\" and announced to him his life\'s work. Simonresponded at once to the call to become a disciple, and afterthis we find him in constant attendance on our Lord.<br><br>He is next called into the rank of the apostleship, and becomesa \"fisher of men\" (Matt. 4:19) in the stormy seas of the worldof human life (Matt. 10:2-4; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:13-16), andtakes a more and more prominent part in all the leading eventsof our Lord\'s life. It is he who utters that notable professionof faith at Capernaum (John 6:66-69), and again at CaesareaPhilippi (Matt. 16:13-20; Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-20). Thisprofession at Caesarea was one of supreme importance, and ourLord in response used these memorable words: \"Thou art Peter,and upon this rock I will build my church.\"<br><br>\"From that time forth\" Jesus began to speak of his sufferings.For this Peter rebuked him. But our Lord in return rebukedPeter, speaking to him in sterner words than he ever used to anyother of his disciples (Matt. 16:21-23; Mark 8:31-33). At theclose of his brief sojourn at Caesarea our Lord took Peter andJames and John with him into \"an high mountain apart,\" and wastransfigured before them. Peter on that occasion, under theimpression the scene produced on his mind, exclaimed, \"Lord, itis good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles\" (Matt.17:1-9).<br><br>On his return to Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax (adidrachma, half a sacred shekel), which every Israelite oftwenty years old and upwards had to pay (Ex. 30:15), came toPeter and reminded him that Jesus had not paid it (Matt.17:24-27). Our Lord instructed Peter to go and catch a fish inthe lake and take from its mouth the exact amount needed for thetax, viz., a stater, or two half-shekels. \"That take,\" said ourLord, \"and give unto them for me and thee.\"<br><br>As the end was drawing nigh, our Lord sent Peter and John (Luke22:7-13) into the city to prepare a place where he should keepthe feast with his disciples. There he was forewarned of thefearful sin into which he afterwards fell (22:31-34). Heaccompanied our Lord from the guest-chamber to the garden ofGethsemane (Luke 22:39-46), which he and the other two who hadbeen witnesses of the transfiguration were permitted to enterwith our Lord, while the rest were left without. Here he passedthrough a strange experience. Under a sudden impulse he cut offthe ear of Malchus (47-51), one of the band that had come forthto take Jesus. Then follow the scenes of the judgment-hall(54-61) and his bitter grief (62).<br><br>He is found in John\'s company early on the morning of theresurrection. He boldly entered into the empty grave (John20:1-10), and saw the \"linen clothes laid by themselves\" (Luke24:9-12). To him, the first of the apostles, our risen Lordrevealed himself, thus conferring on him a signal honour, andshowing how fully he was restored to his favour (Luke 24:34; 1Cor. 15:5). We next read of our Lord\'s singular interview withPeter on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where he thrice askedhim, \"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?\" (John 21:1-19). (See[470]LOVE.)<br><br>After this scene at the lake we hear nothing of Peter till heagain appears with the others at the ascension (Acts 1:15-26).It was he who proposed that the vacancy caused by the apostasyof Judas should be filled up. He is prominent on the day ofPentecost (2:14-40). The events of that day \"completed thechange in Peter himself which the painful discipline of his falland all the lengthened process of previous training had beenslowly making. He is now no more the unreliable, changeful,self-confident man, ever swaying between rash courage and weaktimidity, but the stead-fast, trusted guide and director of thefellowship of believers, the intrepid preacher of Christ inJerusalem and abroad. And now that he is become Cephas indeed,we hear almost nothing of the name Simon (only in Acts 10:5, 32;15:14), and he is known to us finally as Peter.\"<br><br>After the miracle at the temple gate (Acts 3) persecution aroseagainst the Christians, and Peter was cast into prison. Heboldly defended himself and his companions at the bar of thecouncil (4:19, 20). A fresh outburst of violence against theChristians (5:17-21) led to the whole body of the apostles beingcast into prison; but during the night they were wonderfullydelivered, and were found in the morning teaching in the temple.A second time Peter defended them before the council (Acts5:29-32), who, \"when they had called the apostles and beatenthem, let them go.\"<br><br>The time had come for Peter to leave Jerusalem. After labouringfor some time in Samaria, he returned to Jerusalem, and reportedto the church there the results of his work (Acts 8:14-25). Herehe remained for a period, during which he met Paul for the firsttime since his conversion (9:26-30; Gal. 1:18). LeavingJerusalem again, he went forth on a missionary journey to Lyddaand Joppa (Acts 9:32-43). He is next called on to open the doorof the Christian church to the Gentiles by the admission ofCornelius of Caesarea (ch. 10).<br><br>After remaining for some time at Caesarea, he returned toJerusalem (Acts 11:1-18), where he defended his conduct withreference to the Gentiles. Next we hear of his being cast intoprison by Herod Agrippa (12:1-19); but in the night an angel ofthe Lord opened the prison gates, and he went forth and foundrefuge in the house of Mary.<br><br>He took part in the deliberations of the council in Jerusalem(Acts 15:1-31; Gal. 2:1-10) regarding the relation of theGentiles to the church.

The wife ofAmenophis III., of that dynasty, was a Semite. Is this singularfact to be explained from the presence of some of Joseph\'skindred at the Egyptian court? Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Thyfather and thy brethren are come unto thee: the land of Egypt isbefore thee; in the best of the land make thy father andbrethren to dwell\" (Gen. 47:5, 6).<br><br>(3.) The \"new king who knew not Joseph\" (Ex. 1:8-22) has beengenerally supposed to have been Aahmes I., or Amosis, as he iscalled by Josephus. Recent discoveries, however, have led to theconclusion that Seti was the \"new king.\"<br><br>For about seventy years the Hebrews in Egypt were under thepowerful protection of Joseph. After his death their conditionwas probably very slowly and gradually changed. The invaders,the Hyksos, who for some five centuries had been masters ofEgypt, were driven out, and the old dynasty restored. TheIsraelites now began to be looked down upon. They began to beafflicted and tyrannized over. In process of time a changeappears to have taken place in the government of Egypt. A newdynasty, the Nineteenth, as it is called, came into power underSeti I., who was its founder. He associated with him in hisgovernment his son, Rameses II., when he was yet young, probablyten or twelve years of age.<br><br>Note, Professor Maspero, keeper of the museum of Bulak, nearCairo, had his attention in 1870 directed to the fact thatscarabs, i.e., stone and metal imitations of the beetle (symbolsof immortality), originally worn as amulets by royal personages,which were evidently genuine relics of the time of the ancientPharaohs, were being sold at Thebes and different places alongthe Nile. This led him to suspect that some hithertoundiscovered burial-place of the Pharaohs had been opened, andthat these and other relics, now secretly sold, were a part ofthe treasure found there. For a long time he failed, with allhis ingenuity, to find the source of these rare treasures. Atlength one of those in the secret volunteered to giveinformation regarding this burial-place. The result was that aparty was conducted in 1881 to Dier el-Bahari, near Thebes, whenthe wonderful discovery was made of thirty-six mummies of kings,queens, princes, and high priests hidden away in a cavernprepared for them, where they had lain undisturbed for thirtycenturies. \"The temple of Deir el-Bahari stands in the middle ofa natural amphitheatre of cliffs, which is only one of a numberof smaller amphitheatres into which the limestone mountains ofthe tombs are broken up. In the wall of rock separating thisbasin from the one next to it some ancient Egyptian engineershad constructed the hiding-place, whose secret had been kept fornearly three thousand years.\" The exploring party being guidedto the place, found behind a great rock a shaft 6 feet squareand about 40 feet deep, sunk into the limestone. At the bottomof this a passage led westward for 25 feet, and then turnedsharply northward into the very heart of the mountain, where ina chamber 23 feet by 13, and 6 feet in height, they came uponthe wonderful treasures of antiquity. The mummies were allcarefully secured and brought down to Bulak, where they weredeposited in the royal museum, which has now been removed toGhizeh.<br><br>Among the most notable of the ancient kings of Egypt thusdiscovered were Thothmes III., Seti I., and Rameses II. ThothmesIII. was the most distinguished monarch of the brilliantEighteenth Dynasty. When this mummy was unwound \"once more,after an interval of thirty-six centuries, human eyes gazed onthe features of the man who had conquered Syria and Cyprus andEthiopia, and had raised Egypt to the highest pinnacle of herpower. The spectacle, however, was of brief duration. Theremains proved to be in so fragile a state that there was onlytime to take a hasty photograph, and then the features crumbledto pieces and vanished like an apparition, and so passed awayfrom human view for ever.\" \"It seems strange that though thebody of this man,\" who overran Palestine with his armies twohundred years before the birth of Moses, \"mouldered to dust, theflowers with which it had been wreathed were so wonderfullypreserved that even their colour could be distinguished\"(Manning\'s Land of the Pharaohs).<br><br>Seti I. (his throne name Merenptah), the father of Rameses II.,was a great and successful warrior, also a great builder. Themummy of this Pharaoh, when unrolled, brought to view \"the mostbeautiful mummy head ever seen within the walls of the museum.The sculptors of Thebes and Abydos did not flatter this Pharaohwhen they gave him that delicate, sweet, and smiling profilewhich is the admiration of travellers. After a lapse ofthirty-two centuries, the mummy retains the same expressionwhich characterized the features of the living man. Mostremarkable of all, when compared with the mummy of Rameses II.,is the striking resemblance between the father and the son. SetiI. is, as it were, the idealized type of Rameses II. He musthave died at an advanced age. The head is shaven, the eyebrowsare white, the condition of the body points to considerably morethan threescore years of life, thus confirming the opinions ofthe learned, who have attributed a long reign to this king.\"<br><br>(4.) Rameses II., the son of Seti I., is probably the Pharaoh ofthe Oppression. During his forty years\' residence at the courtof Egypt, Moses must have known this ruler well. During hissojourn in Midian, however, Rameses died, after a reign ofsixty-seven years, and his body embalmed and laid in the royalsepulchre in the Valley of the Tombs of Kings beside that of hisfather. Like the other mummies found hidden in the cave of Deirel-Bahari, it had been for some reason removed from its originaltomb, and probably carried from place to place till finallydeposited in the cave where it was so recently discovered.<br><br>In 1886, the mummy of this king, the \"great Rameses,\" the\"Sesostris\" of the Greeks, was unwound, and showed the body ofwhat must have been a robust old man. The features revealed toview are thus described by Maspero: \"The head is long and smallin proportion to the body. The top of the skull is quite bare.On the temple there are a few sparse hairs, but at the poll thehair is quite thick, forming smooth, straight locks about twoinches in length. White at the time of death, they have beendyed a light yellow by the spices used in embalmment. Theforehead is low and narrow; the brow-ridge prominent; theeye-brows are thick and white; the eyes are small and closetogether; the nose is long, thin, arched like the noses of theBourbons; the temples are sunk; the cheek-bones very prominent;the ears round, standing far out from the head, and pierced,like those of a woman, for the wearing of earrings; the jaw-boneis massive and strong; the chin very prominent; the mouth small,but thick-lipped; the teeth worn and very brittle, but white andwell preserved. The moustache and beard are thin. They seem tohave been kept shaven during life, but were probably allowed togrow during the king\'s last illness, or they may have grownafter death. The hairs are white, like those of the head andeyebrows, but are harsh and bristly, and a tenth of an inch inlength. The skin is of an earthy-brown, streaked with black.Finally, it may be said, the face of the mummy gives a fair ideaof the face of the living king. The expression isunintellectual, perhaps slightly animal; but even under thesomewhat grotesque disguise of mummification there is plainly tobe seen an air of sovereign majesty, of resolve, and of pride.\"<br><br>Both on his father\'s and his mother\'s side it has been prettyclearly shown that Rameses had Chaldean or Mesopotamian blood inhis veins to such a degree that he might be called an Assyrian.This fact is thought to throw light on Isa. 52:4.<br><br>(5.) The Pharaoh of the Exodus was probably Menephtah I., thefourteenth and eldest surviving son of Rameses II. He resided atZoan, where he had the various interviews with Moses and Aaronrecorded in the book of Exodus. His mummy was not among thosefound at Deir el-Bahari. It is still a question, however,whether Seti II. or his father Menephtah was the Pharaoh of theExodus. Some think the balance of evidence to be in favour ofthe former, whose reign it is known began peacefully, but cameto a sudden and disastrous end. The \"Harris papyrus,\" found atMedinet-Abou in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written byRameses III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives atlength an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed bywide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great reasonto believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the NineteenthDynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This period of anarchywas brought to a close by Setnekht, the founder of the TwentiethDynasty.<br><br>\"In the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie discovered,among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at Thebes, a largegranite stela, on which is engraved a hymn of victorycommemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who had overrun theDelta. At the end other victories of Menephtah are glanced at,and it is said that the Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) areminished (?) so that they have no seed.\' Menephtah was son andsuccessor of Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptianscholars have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. TheExodus is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of theevent preserved by the historian Manetho. In the inscription thename of the Israelites has no determinative of country\' or\'district\' attached to it, as is the case with all the othernames (Canaan, Ashkelon, Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine,etc.) mentioned along with it, and it would therefore appearthat at the time the hymn was composed, the Israelites hadalready been lost to the sight of the Egyptians in the desert.At all events they must have had as yet no fixed home ordistrict of their own. We may therefore see in the reference tothem the Pharaoh\'s version of the Exodus, the disasters whichbefell the Egyptians being naturally passed over in silence, andonly the destruction of the men children\' of the Israelitesbeing recorded.

In the whole record fromExodus to Samuel they are represented as inhabiting the tract ofcountry which lay between Judea and Egypt (Ex. 13:17; 15:14, 15;Josh. 13:3; 1 Sam. 4).<br><br>This powerful tribe made frequent incursions against theHebrews. There was almost perpetual war between them. Theysometimes held the tribes, especially the southern tribes, indegrading servitude (Judg. 15:11; 1 Sam. 13:19-22); at othertimes they were defeated with great slaughter (1 Sam. 14:1-47;17). These hostilities did not cease till the time of Hezekiah(2 Kings 18:8), when they were entirely subdued. They still,however, occupied their territory, and always showed their oldhatred to Israel (Ezek. 25:15-17). They were finally conqueredby the Romans.<br><br>The Philistines are called Pulsata or Pulista on the Egyptianmonuments; the land of the Philistines (Philistia) being termedPalastu and Pilista in the Assyrian inscriptions. They occupiedthe five cities of Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath, inthe south-western corner of Canaan, which belonged to Egypt upto the closing days of the Nineteenth Dynasty. The occupationtook place during the reign of Rameses III. of the TwentiethDynasty. The Philistines had formed part of the great navalconfederacy which attacked Egypt, but were eventually repulsedby that Pharaoh, who, however, could not dislodge them fromtheir settlements in Palestine. As they did not enter Palestinetill the time of the Exodus, the use of the name Philistines inGen. 26:1 must be proleptic. Indeed the country was properlyGerar, as in ch. 20.<br><br>They are called Allophyli, \"foreigners,\" in the Septuagint, andin the Books of Samuel they are spoken of as uncircumcised. Itwould therefore appear that they were not of the Semitic race,though after their establishment in Canaan they adopted theSemitic language of the country. We learn from the Old Testamentthat they came from Caphtor, usually supposed to be Crete. FromPhilistia the name of the land of the Philistines came to beextended to the whole of \"Palestine.\" Many scholars identify thePhilistines with the Pelethites of 2 Sam. 8:18.<br><br>'),

He afterwards commanded the army that wentout against the Midianites (31:6-8). When representatives of thepeople were sent to expostulate with the two and a half tribeswho, just after crossing Jordan, built an altar and departedwithout giving any explanation, Phinehas was their leader, andaddressed them in the words recorded in Josh. 22:16-20. Theirexplanation follows. This great altar was intended to be allages only a witness that they still formed a part of Israel.Phinehas was afterwards the chief adviser in the war with theBenjamites.

(2954, 'Pilate, Pontius', 'Probably connected with the Roman family of the Pontii, andcalled \"Pilate\" from the Latin pileatus, i.e., \"wearing thepileus\", which was the \"cap or badge of a manumitted slave,\" asindicating that he was a \"freedman,\" or the descendant of one.He was the sixth in the order of the Roman procurators of Judea(A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea, but hefrequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over theperiod of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus Christ,in connection with whose trial his name comes into prominentnotice. Pilate was a \"typical Roman, not of the antique, simplestamp, but of the imperial period, a man not without someremains of the ancient Roman justice in his soul, yetpleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt. He hated the Jews whomhe ruled, and in times of irritation freely shed their blood.They returned his hatred with cordiality, and accused him ofevery crime, maladministration, cruelty, and robbery. He visitedJerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one accustomedto the pleasures of Rome, with its theatres, baths, games, andgay society, Jerusalem, with its religiousness andever-smouldering revolt, was a dreary residence. When he didvisit it he stayed in the palace of Herod the Great, it beingcommon for the officers sent by Rome into conquered countries tooccupy the palaces of the displaced sovereigns.\"<br><br>After his trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus was brought to theRoman procurator, Pilate, who had come up to Jerusalem as usualto preserve order during the Passover, and was now residing,perhaps, in the castle of Antonia, or it may be in Herod\'spalace. Pilate came forth from his palace and met the deputationfrom the Sanhedrin, who, in answer to his inquiry as to thenature of the accusation they had to prefer against Jesus,accused him of being a \"malefactor.\" Pilate was not satisfiedwith this, and they further accused him (1) of sedition, (2)preventing the payment of the tribute to Caesar, and (3) ofassuming the title of king (Luke 23:2). Pilate now withdrew withJesus into the palace (John 18:33) and examined him in private(37, 38); and then going out to the deputation still standingbefore the gate, he declared that he could find no fault inJesus (Luke 23:4). This only aroused them to more furiousclamour, and they cried that he excited the populace \"throughoutall Jewry, beginning from Galilee.\" When Pilate heard ofGalilee, he sent the accused to Herod Antipas, who hadjurisdiction over that province, thus hoping to escape thedifficulty in which he found himself. But Herod, with his men ofwar, set Jesus at nought, and sent him back again to Pilate,clad in a purple robe of mockery (23:11, 12).<br><br>Pilate now proposed that as he and Herod had found no fault inhim, they should release Jesus; and anticipating that they wouldconsent to this proposal, he ascended the judgment-seat as ifready to ratify the decision (Matt. 27:19). But at this momenthis wife (Claudia Procula) sent a message to him imploring himto have nothing to do with the \"just person.\" Pilate\'s feelingsof perplexity and awe were deepened by this incident, while thecrowd vehemently cried out, \"Not this man, but Barabbas.\" Pilateanswered, \"What then shall I do with Jesus?\" The fierce cryimmediately followed. \"Let him be crucified.\" Pilate, apparentlyvexed, and not knowning what to do, said, \"Why, what evil hathhe done?\" but with yet fiercer fanaticism the crowd yelled out,\"Away with him! crucify him, crucify him!\" Pilate yielded, andsent Jesus away to be scourged. This scourging was usuallyinflicted by lictors; but as Pilate was only a procurator he hadno lictor, and hence his soldiers inflicted this terriblepunishment. This done, the soldiers began to deride thesufferer, and they threw around him a purple robe, probably someold cast-off robe of state (Matt. 27:28; John 19:2), and puttinga reed in his right hand, and a crowd of thorns on his head,bowed the knee before him in mockery, and saluted him, saying,\"Hail, King of the Jews!\" They took also the reed and smote himwith it on the head and face, and spat in his face, heaping uponhim every indignity.<br><br>Pilate then led forth Jesus from within the Praetorium (Matt.27:27) before the people, wearing the crown of thorns and thepurple robe, saying, \"Behold the man!\" But the sight of Jesus,now scourged and crowned and bleeding, only stirred their hatredthe more, and again they cried out, \"Crucify him, crucify him!\"and brought forth this additional charge against him, that heprofessed to be \"the Son of God.\" Pilate heard this accusationwith a superstitious awe, and taking him once more within thePraetorium, asked him, \"Whence art thou?\" Jesus gave him noanswer. Pilate was irritated by his continued silence, and said,\"Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee?\" Jesus,with calm dignity, answered the Roman, \"Thou couldest have nopower at all against me, except it were given thee from above.\"<br><br>After this Pilate seemed more resolved than ever to let Jesusgo. The crowd perceiving this cried out, \"If thou let this mango, thou art not Caesar\'s friend.\" This settled the matter. Hewas afraid of being accused to the emperor. Calling for water,he washed his hands in the sight of the people, saying, \"I aminnocent of the blood of this just person.\" The mob, againscorning his scruples, cried, \"His blood be on us, and on ourchildren.\" Pilate was stung to the heart by their insults, andputting forth Jesus before them, said, \"Shall I crucify yourKing?\" The fatal moment had now come. They madly exclaimed, \"Wehave no king but Caesar;\" and now Jesus is given up to them, andled away to be crucified.<br><br>By the direction of Pilate an inscription was placed, accordingto the Roman custom, over the cross, stating the crime for whichhe was crucified. Having ascertained from the centurion that hewas dead, he gave up the body to Joseph of Arimathea to beburied. Pilate\'s name now disappears from the Gospel history.References to him, however, are found in the Acts of theApostles (3:13; 4:27; 13:28), and in 1 Tim. 6:13.

(2976, 'Poetry', 'Has been well defined as \"the measured language of emotion.\"Hebrew poetry deals almost exclusively with the great questionof man\'s relation to God. \"Guilt, condemnation, punishment,pardon, redemption, repentance are the awful themes of thisheaven-born poetry.\"<br><br>In the Hebrew scriptures there are found three distinct kinds ofpoetry, (1) that of the Book of Job and the Song of Solomon,which is dramatic; (2) that of the Book of Psalms, which islyrical; and (3) that of the Book of Ecclesiastes, which isdidactic and sententious.<br><br>Hebrew poetry has nothing akin to that of Western nations. Ithas neither metre nor rhyme. Its great peculiarity consists inthe mutual correspondence of sentences or clauses, calledparallelism, or \"thought-rhyme.\" Various kinds of thisparallelism have been pointed out:<br><br>(1.) Synonymous or cognate parallelism, where the same idea isrepeated in the same words (Ps. 93:3; 94:1; Prov. 6:2), or indifferent words (Ps. 22, 23, 28, 114, etc.); or where it isexpressed in a positive form in the one clause and in a negativein the other (Ps. 40:12; Prov. 6:26); or where the same idea isexpressed in three successive clauses (Ps. 40:15, 16); or in adouble parallelism, the first and second clauses correspondingto the third and fourth (Isa. 9:1; 61:10, 11).<br><br>(2.) Antithetic parallelism, where the idea of the second clauseis the converse of that of the first (Ps. 20:8; 27:6, 7; 34:11;37:9, 17, 21, 22). This is the common form of gnomic orproverbial poetry. (See Prov. 10-15.)<br><br>(3.) Synthetic or constructive or compound parallelism, whereeach clause or sentence contains some accessory idea enforcingthe main idea (Ps. 19:7-10; 85:12; Job 3:3-9; Isa. 1:5-9).<br><br>(4.) Introverted parallelism, in which of four clauses the firstanswers to the fourth and the second to the third (Ps.135:15-18; Prov. 23:15, 16), or where the second line reversesthe order of words in the first (Ps. 86:2).<br><br>Hebrew poetry sometimes assumes other forms than these. (1.) Analphabetical arrangement is sometimes adopted for the purpose ofconnecting clauses or sentences. Thus in the following theinitial words of the respective verses begin with the letters ofthe alphabet in regular succession: Prov. 31:10-31; Lam. 1, 2,3, 4; Ps. 25, 34, 37, 145. Ps. 119 has a letter of the alphabetin regular order beginning every eighth verse.<br><br>(2.) The repetition of the same verse or of some emphaticexpression at intervals (Ps. 42, 107, where the refrain is inverses, 8, 15, 21, 31). (Comp. also Isa. 9:8-10:4; Amos 1:3, 6,9, 11, 13; 2:1, 4, 6.)<br><br>(3.) Gradation, in which the thought of one verse is resumed inanother (Ps. 121).<br><br>Several odes of great poetical beauty are found in thehistorical books of the Old Testament, such as the song of Moses(Ex. 15), the song of Deborah (Judg. 5), of Hannah (1 Sam. 2),of Hezekiah (Isa. 38:9-20), of Habakkuk (Hab. 3), and David\'s\"song of the bow\" (2 Sam. 1:19-27).<br><br>'),

Theyare 150 feet distant from each other, and each pool is 20 feetlower than that above it, the conduits being so arranged thatthe lowest, which is the largest and finest of the three, isfilled first, and then in succession the others.

From the lower pool an aqueduct has been traced conveyingthe water through Bethlehem and across the valley of Gihon, andalong the west slope of the Tyropoeon valley, till it finds itsway into the great cisterns underneath the temple hill.

(SeeEpistle to the Hebrews throughout.) The term \"priest\" is indeedapplied to believers (1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6), but in these casesit implies no sacerdotal functions. All true believers are now\"kings and priests unto God.\" As priests they have free accessinto the holiest of all, and offer up the sacrifices of praiseand thanksgiving, and the sacrifices of grateful service fromday to day.<br><br>'),
(3002, 'Prince', 'The title generally applied to the chief men of the state. The\"princes of the provinces\" (1 Kings 20:14) were the governors orlord-lieutenants of the provinces.

These are also called \"lieutenants\" (Esther3:12; 8:9; R.V., \"satraps\"). The promised Saviour is called byDaniel (9:25) \"Messiah the Prince\" (Heb. nagid); compare Acts3:15; 5:31.

(3005, 'Prophecy', 'Or prediction, was one of the functions of the prophet. It hasbeen defined as a \"miracle of knowledge, a declaration ordescription or representation of something future, beyond thepower of human sagacity to foresee, discern, or conjecture.\"(See [509]PROPHET.)<br><br>The great prediction which runs like a golden thread through thewhole contents of the Old Testament is that regarding the comingand work of the Messiah; and the great use of prophecy was toperpetuate faith in his coming, and to prepare the world forthat event. But there are many subordinate and intermediateprophecies also which hold an important place in the great chainof events which illustrate the sovereignty and all-wiseoverruling providence of God.<br><br>Then there are many prophecies regarding the Jewish nation, itsfounder Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3; 13:16; 15:5; 17:2, 4-6, etc.), andhis posterity, Isaac and Jacob and their descendants (12:7;13:14, 15, 17; 15:18-21; Ex. 3:8, 17), which have all beenfulfilled. The twenty-eighth chapter of Deuteronomy contains aseries of predictions which are even now in the present daybeing fulfilled. In the writings of the prophets Isaiah(2:18-21), Jeremiah (27:3-7; 29:11-14), Ezekiel (5:12; 8),Daniel (8; 9:26, 27), Hosea (9:17), there are also manyprophecies regarding the events which were to befall thatpeople.<br><br>There is in like manner a large number of prophecies relating tothose nations with which the Jews came into contact, as Tyre(Ezek. 26:3-5, 14-21), Egypt (Ezek. 29:10, 15; 30:6, 12, 13),Ethiopia (Nahum 3:8-10), Nineveh (Nahum 1:10; 2:8-13; 3:17-19),Babylon (Isa. 13:4; Jer. 51:7; Isa. 44:27; Jer. 50:38; 51:36,39, 57), the land of the Philistines (Jer. 47:4-7; Ezek.25:15-17; Amos 1:6-8; Zeph. 2:4-7; Zech. 9:5-8), and of the fourgreat monarchies (Dan. 2:39, 40; 7:17-24; 8:9).<br><br>But the great body of Old Testament prophecy relates directly tothe advent of the Messiah, beginning with Gen. 3:15, the firstgreat promise, and extending in ever-increasing fulness andclearness all through to the very close of the canon. TheMessianic prophecies are too numerous to be quoted. \"To him gaveall the prophets witness.\" (Comp. Micah 5:2; Hag. 2:6-9; Isa.7:14; 9:6, 7; 11:1, 2; 53; 60:10, 13; Ps. 16:11; 68:18.)<br><br>Many predictions also were delivered by Jesus and his apostles.Those of Christ were very numerous. (Comp.

(3006, 'Prophet', '(Heb. nabi, from a root meaning \"to bubble forth, as from afountain,\" hence \"to utter\", comp. Ps. 45:1). This Hebrew wordis the first and the most generally used for a prophet. In thetime of Samuel another word, ro\'eh, \"seer\", began to be used (1Sam. 9:9). It occurs seven times in reference to Samuel.Afterwards another word, hozeh, \"seer\" (2 Sam. 24:11), wasemployed. In 1 Ch. 29:29 all these three words are used: \"Samuelthe seer (ro\'eh), Nathan the prophet (nabi\'), Gad the seer\"(hozeh). In Josh. 13:22 Balaam is called (Heb.) a kosem\"diviner,\" a word used only of a false prophet.<br><br>The \"prophet\" proclaimed the message given to him, as the \"seer\"beheld the vision of God. (See Num. 12:6, 8.) Thus a prophet wasa spokesman for God; he spake in God\'s name and by his authority(Ex. 7:1). He is the mouth by which God speaks to men (Jer. 1:9;Isa. 51:16), and hence what the prophet says is not of man butof God (2 Pet. 1:20, 21; comp. Heb. 3:7; Acts 4:25; 28:25).Prophets were the immediate organs of God for the communicationof his mind and will to men (Deut. 18:18, 19). The whole Word ofGod may in this general sense be spoken of as prophetic,inasmuch as it was written by men who received the revelationthey communicated from God, no matter what its nature might be.The foretelling of future events was not a necessary but only anincidental part of the prophetic office. The great task assignedto the prophets whom God raised up among the people was \"tocorrect moral and religious abuses, to proclaim the great moraland religious truths which are connected with the character ofGod, and which lie at the foundation of his government.\"<br><br>Any one being a spokesman for God to man might thus be called aprophet. Thus Enoch, Abraham, and the patriarchs, as bearers ofGod\'s message (Gen. 20:7; Ex. 7:1; Ps. 105:15), as also Moses(Deut. 18:15; 34:10; Hos. 12:13), are ranked among the prophets.The seventy elders of Israel (Num. 11:16-29), \"when the spiritrested upon them, prophesied;\" Asaph and Jeduthun \"prophesiedwith a harp\" (1 Chr. 25:3). Miriam and Deborah were prophetesses(Ex. 15:20; Judg. 4:4). The title thus has a general applicationto all who have messages from God to men.<br><br>But while the prophetic gift was thus exercised from thebeginning, the prophetical order as such began with Samuel.Colleges, \"schools of the prophets\", were instituted for thetraining of prophets, who were constituted, a distinct order (1Sam. 19:18-24; 2 Kings 2:3, 15; 4:38), which continued to theclose of the Old Testament. Such \"schools\" were established atRamah, Bethel, Gilgal, Gibeah, and Jericho. The \"sons\" or\"disciples\" of the prophets were young men (2 Kings 5:22; 9:1,4) who lived together at these different \"schools\" (4:38-41).These young men were taught not only the rudiments of secularknowledge, but they were brought up to exercise the office ofprophet, \"to preach pure morality and the heart-felt worship ofJehovah, and to act along and co-ordinately with the priesthoodand monarchy in guiding the state aright and checking allattempts at illegality and tyranny.\"<br><br>In New Testament times the prophetical office was continued. OurLord is frequently spoken of as a prophet (Luke 13:33; 24:19).He was and is the great Prophet of the Church. There was also inthe Church a distinct order of prophets (1 Cor. 12:28; Eph.2:20; 3:5), who made new revelations from God. They differedfrom the \"teacher,\" whose office it was to impart truths alreadyrevealed.<br><br>Of the Old Testament prophets there are sixteen, whoseprophecies form part of the inspired canon. These are dividedinto four groups:<br><br>(1.) The prophets of the northern kingdom (Israel), viz., Hosea,Amos, Joel, Jonah.<br><br>(2.) The prophets of Judah, viz., Isaiah, Jeremiah, Obadiah,Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah.<br><br>(3.) The prophets of Captivity, viz., Ezekiel and Daniel.<br><br>(4.) The prophets of the Restoration, viz., Haggai, Zechariah,and Malachi.<br><br>'),
(3007, 'Propitiation', 'That by which God is rendered propitious, i.e., by which itbecomes consistent with his character and government to pardonand bless the sinner. The propitiation does not procure his loveor make him loving; it only renders it consistent for him toexecise his love towards sinners.<br><br>In Rom. 3:25 and Heb. 9:5 (A.V., \"mercy-seat\") the Greek wordhilasterion is used. It is the word employed by the LXX.translators in Ex. 25:17 and elsewhere as the equivalent for theHebrew kapporeth, which means \"covering,\" and is used of the lidof the ark of the covenant (Ex. 25:21; 30:6). This Greek word(hilasterion) came to denote not only the mercy-seat or lid ofthe ark, but also propitation or reconciliation by blood. On thegreat day of atonement the high priest carried the blood of thesacrifice he offered for all the people within the veil andsprinkled with it the \"mercy-seat,\" and so made propitiation.<br><br>In 1 John 2:2; 4:10, Christ is called the \"propitiation for oursins.\" Here a different Greek word is used (hilasmos). Christ is\"the propitiation,\" because by his becoming our substitute andassuming our obligations he expiated our guilt, covered it, bythe vicarious punishment which he endured. (Comp. Heb. 2:17,where the expression \"make reconciliation\" of the A.V. is morecorrectly in the R.V. \"make propitiation.\")<br><br>'),
(3008, 'Proportion of faith', '(Rom. 12:6). Paul says here that each one was to exercise hisgift of prophecy, i.e., of teaching, \"according to theproportion of faith.\" The meaning is, that the utterances of the\"prophet\" were not to fluctuate according to his own impulses orindependent thoughts, but were to be adjusted to the truthrevealed to him as a beliver, i.e., were to be in accordancewith it.<br><br>In post-Reformation times this phrase was used as meaning thatall Scripture was to be interpreted with reference to all otherScripture, i.e., that no words or expressions were to beisolated or interpreted in a way contrary to its generalteaching.

There weresuch converts from early times (Isa. 56:3; Neh. 10:28; Esther8:17).

The Kenites, the Gibeonites, the Cherethites, and thePelethites were thus admitted to the privileges of Israelites.Thus also we hear of individual proselytes who rose to positionsof prominence in Israel, as of Doeg the Edomite, Uriah theHittite, Araunah the Jebusite, Zelek the Ammonite, Ithmah andEbedmelech the Ethiopians.<br><br>In the time of Solomon there were one hundred and fifty-threethousand six hundred strangers in the land of Israel (1 Chr.22:2; 2 Chr. 2:17, 18). And the prophets speak of the time ascoming when the strangers shall share in all the privileges ofIsrael (Ezek. 47:22; Isa. 2:2; 11:10; 56:3-6; Micah 4:1).Accordingly, in New Testament times, we read of proselytes inthe synagogues, (Acts 10:2, 7; 13:42, 43, 50; 17:4; 18:7; Luke7:5). The \"religious proselytes\" here spoken of were proselytesof righteousness, as distinguished from proselytes of the gate.<br><br>The distinction between \"proselytes of the gate\" (Ex. 20:10) and\"proselytes of righteousness\" originated only with the rabbis.According to them, the \"proselytes of the gate\" (halfproselytes) were not required to be circumcised nor to complywith the Mosaic ceremonial law. They were bound only to conformto the so-called seven precepts of Noah, viz., to abstain fromidolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, uncleaness, the eating of blood,theft, and to yield obedience to the authorities. Besides theselaws, however, they were required to abstain from work on theSabbath, and to refrain from the use of leavened bread duringthe time of the Passover.<br><br>The \"proselytes of righteousness\", religious or devoutproselytes (Acts 13:43), were bound to all the doctrines andprecepts of the Jewish economy, and were members of thesynagogue in full communion.<br><br>The name \"proselyte\" occurs in the New Testament only in Matt.23:15; Acts 2:10; 6:5; 13:43.

Rom. 5:10 refers not to any change in our dispositiontoward God, but to God himself, as the party reconciled. Romans5:11 teaches the same truth. From God we have received \"thereconciliation\" (R.V.), i.e., he has conferred on us the tokenof his friendship. So also 2 Cor. 5:18, 19 speaks of areconciliation originating with God, and consisting in theremoval of his merited wrath. In Eph. 2:16 it is clear that theapostle does not refer to the winning back of the sinner in loveand loyalty to God, but to the restoration of God\'s forfeitedfavour. This is effected by his justice being satisfied, so thathe can, in consistency with his own nature, be favourable towardsinners. Justice demands the punishment of sinners.

The idea running through all these texts, however varioustheir reference, is that of payment made for our redemption. Thedebt against us is not viewed as simply cancelled, but is fullypaid. Christ\'s blood or life, which he surrendered for them, isthe \"ransom\" by which the deliverance of his people from theservitude of sin and from its penal consequences is secured. Itis the plain doctrine of Scripture that \"Christ saves us neitherby the mere exercise of power, nor by his doctrine, nor by hisexample, nor by the moral influence which he exerted, nor by anysubjective influence on his people, whether natural or mystical,but as a satisfaction to divine justice, as an expiation forsin, and as a ransom from the curse and authority of the law,thus reconciling us to God by making it consistent with hisperfection to exercise mercy toward sinners\" (Hodge\'s SystematicTheology).<br><br>'),

Some have argued that thecrossing took place opposite the Wady Tawarik, where the sea isat present some 7 miles broad.

He sought refuge in \"thehold\" at Adullam (2 Sam. 5:17-22), and the Philistines took uptheir position in the valley of Rephaim, on the west andsouth-west of Jerusalem. Thus all communication betweenBethlehem and Jerusalem was intercepted. While David and hisarmy were encamped here, there occurred that incident narratedin 2 Sam. 23:15-17. Having obtained divine direction, David ledhis army against the Philistines, and gained a complete victoryover them. The scene of this victory was afterwards calledBaalperazim (q.v.).<br><br>A second time, however, the Philistines rallied their forces inthis valley (2 Sam. 5:22).

(3114, 'Resurrection of Christ', 'One of the cardinal facts and doctrines of the gospel. If Christbe not risen, our faith is vain (1 Cor. 15:14). The whole of theNew Testament revelation rests on this as an historical fact. Onthe day of Pentecost Peter argued the necessity of Christ\'sresurrection from the prediction in Ps. 16 (Acts 2:24-28). Inhis own discourses, also, our Lord clearly intimates hisresurrection (Matt. 20:19; Mark 9:9; 14:28; Luke 18:33; John2:19-22).<br><br>The evangelists give circumstantial accounts of the factsconnected with that event, and the apostles, also, in theirpublic teaching largely insist upon it. Ten differentappearances of our risen Lord are recorded in the New Testament.They may be arranged as follows:<br><br>(1.) To Mary Magdalene at the sepulchre alone. This is recordedat length only by John (20:11-18), and alluded to by Mark(16:9-11).<br><br>(2.) To certain women, \"the other Mary,\" Salome, Joanna, andothers, as they returned from the sepulchre. Matthew (28:1-10)alone gives an account of this. (Comp. Mark 16:1-8, and Luke24:1-11.)<br><br>(3.) To Simon Peter alone on the day of the resurrection. (SeeLuke 24:34; 1 Cor. 15:5.)<br><br>(4.) To the two disciples on the way to Emmaus on the day of theresurrection, recorded fully only by Luke (24:13-35. Comp. Mark16:12, 13).<br><br>(5.) To the ten disciples (Thomas being absent) and others \"withthem,\" at Jerusalem on the evening of the resurrection day. Oneof the evangelists gives an account of this appearance, John(20:19-24).<br><br>(6.) To the disciples again (Thomas being present) at Jerusalem(Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:33-40; John 20:26-28. See also 1 Cor.15:5).<br><br>(7.) To the disciples when fishing at the Sea of Galilee. Ofthis appearance also John (21:1-23) alone gives an account.<br><br>(8.) To the eleven, and above 500 brethren at once, at anappointed place in Galilee (1 Cor. 15:6; comp. Matt. 28:16-20).<br><br>(9.) To James, but under what circumstances we are not informed(1 Cor. 15:7).<br><br>(10.) To the apostles immediately before the ascension. Theyaccompanied him from Jerusalem to Mount Olivet, and there theysaw him ascend \"till a cloud received him out of their sight\"(Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:4-10).<br><br>It is worthy of note that it is distinctly related that on mostof these occasions our Lord afforded his disciples the amplestopportunity of testing the fact of his resurrection. Heconversed with them face to face. They touched him (Matt. 28:9;Luke 24:39; John 20:27), and he ate bread with them (Luke 24:42,43; John 21:12, 13).<br><br>(11.) In addition to the above, mention might be made ofChrist\'s manifestation of himself to Paul at Damascus, whospeaks of it as an appearance of the risen Saviour (Acts 9:3-9,17; 1 Cor. 15:8; 9:1).<br><br>It is implied in the words of Luke (Acts 1:3) that there mayhave been other appearances of which we have no record.<br><br>The resurrection is spoken of as the act (1) of God the Father(Ps. 16:10; Acts 2:24; 3:15; Rom. 8:11; Eph. 1:20; Col. 2:12;Heb. 13:20); (2) of Christ himself (John 2:19; 10:18); and (3)of the Holy Spirit (1 Peter 3:18).<br><br>The resurrection is a public testimony of Christ\'s release fromhis undertaking as surety, and an evidence of the Father\'sacceptance of his work of redemption. It is a victory over deathand the grave for all his followers.<br><br>The importance of Christ\'s resurrection will be seen when weconsider that if he rose the gospel is true, and if he rose notit is false. His resurrection from the dead makes it manifestthat his sacrifice was accepted. Our justification was securedby his obedience to the death, and therefore he was raised fromthe dead (Rom. 4:25). His resurrection is a proof that he made afull atonement for our sins, that his sacrifice was accepted asa satisfaction to divine justice, and his blood a ransom forsinners. It is also a pledge and an earnest of the resurrectionof all believers (Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 6:14; 15:47-49; Phil. 3:21;1 John 3:2). As he lives, they shall live also.<br><br>It proved him to be the Son of God, inasmuch as it authenticatedall his claims (John 2:19; 10:17). \"If Christ did not rise, thewhole scheme of redemption is a failure, and all the predictionsand anticipations of its glorious results for time and foreternity, for men and for angels of every rank and order, areproved to be chimeras. But now is Christ risen from the dead,and become the first-fruits of them that slept.\' Therefore theBible is true from Genesis to Revelation. The kingdom ofdarkness has been overthrown, Satan has fallen as lightning fromheaven, and the triumph of truth over error, of good over evil,of happiness over misery is for ever secured.\" Hodge.<br><br>With reference to the report which the Roman soldiers werebribed (Matt. 28:12-14) to circulate concerning Christ\'sresurrection, \"his disciples came by night and stole him awaywhile we slept,\" Matthew Henry in his \"Commentary,\" under John20:1-10, fittingly remarks, \"The grave-clothes in which Christhad been buried were found in very good order, which serves foran evidence that his body was not stolen away while men slept.\'Robbers of tombs have been known to take away the clothes\' andleave the body; but none ever took away the body\' and left theclothes, especially when they were fine linen\' and new (Mark15:46).

The qualities ofthe resurrection body will be different from those of the bodylaid in the grave (1 Cor. 15:53, 54; Phil. 3:21); but itsidentity will nevertheless be preserved. It will still be thesame body (1 Cor. 15:42-44) which rises again.<br><br>As to the nature of the resurrection body, (1) it will bespiritual (1 Cor. 15:44), i.e., a body adapted to the use of thesoul in its glorified state, and to all the conditions of theheavenly state; (2) glorious, incorruptible, and powerful (54);(3) like unto the glorified body of Christ (Phil. 3:21); and (4)immortal (Rev. 21:4).<br><br>Christ\'s resurrection secures and illustrates that of hispeople. \"(1.)

Because of ourfederal and vital union with Christ (1 Cor. 15:21, 22; 1 Thess.4:14). (3.) Because of his Spirit which dwells in us making ourbodies his members (1 Cor. 6:15; Rom. 8:11). (4.) Because Christby covenant is Lord both of the living and the dead (Rom. 14:9).This same federal and vital union of the Christian with Christlikewise causes the resurrection of the believer to be similarto as well as consequent upon that of Christ (1 Cor. 15:49;Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2).\" Hodge\'s Outlines of Theology.<br><br>'),

In later times they pervertedthe Sabbath by their traditions. Our Lord rescued it from theirperversions, and recalled to them its true nature and intent(Matt. 12:10-13; Mark 2:27; Luke 13:10-17).<br><br>The Sabbath, originally instituted for man at his creation, isof permanent and universal obligation. The physical necessitiesof man require a Sabbath of rest. He is so constituted that hisbodily welfare needs at least one day in seven for rest fromordinary labour. Experience also proves that the moral andspiritual necessities of men also demand a Sabbath of rest. \"Iam more and more sure by experience that the reason for theobservance of the Sabbath lies deep in the everlastingnecessities of human nature, and that as long as man is man theblessedness of keeping it, not as a day of rest only, but as aday of spiritual rest, will never be annulled. I certainly dofeel by experience the eternal obligation, because of theeternal necessity, of the Sabbath. The soul withers without it.It thrives in proportion to its observance. The Sabbath was madefor man. God made it for men in a certain spiritual statebecause they needed it. The need, therefore, is deeply hidden inhuman nature. He who can dispense with it must be holy andspiritual indeed. And he who, still unholy and unspiritual,would yet dispense with it is a man that would fain be wiserthan his Maker\" (F. W. Robertson).<br><br>The ancient Babylonian calendar, as seen from recently recoveredinscriptions on the bricks among the ruins of the royal palace,was based on the division of time into weeks of seven days. TheSabbath is in these inscriptions designated Sabattu, and definedas \"a day of rest for the heart\" and \"a day of completion oflabour.\"<br><br>The change of the day. Originally at creation the seventh day ofthe week was set apart and consecrated as the Sabbath. The firstday of the week is now observed as the Sabbath. Has Godauthorized this change? There is an obvious distinction betweenthe Sabbath as an institution and the particular day set apartfor its observance. The question, therefore, as to the change ofthe day in no way affects the perpetual obligation of theSabbath as an institution. Change of the day or no change, theSabbath remains as a sacred institution the same. It cannot beabrogated.<br><br>If any change of the day has been made, it must have been byChrist or by his authority. Christ has a right to make such achange (Mark 2:23-28). As Creator, Christ was the original Lordof the Sabbath (John 1:3; Heb. 1:10). It was originally amemorial of creation. A work vastly greater than that ofcreation has now been accomplished by him, the work ofredemption. We would naturally expect just such a change aswould make the Sabbath a memorial of that greater work.<br><br>True, we can give no text authorizing the change in so manywords. We have no express law declaring the change. But thereare evidences of another kind. We know for a fact that the firstday of the week has been observed from apostolic times, and thenecessary conclusion is, that it was observed by the apostlesand their immediate disciples. This, we may be sure, they neverwould have done without the permission or the authority of theirLord.<br><br>After his resurrection, which took place on the first day of theweek (Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:2; Luke 24:1; John 20:1), we neverfind Christ meeting with his disciples on the seventh day. Buthe specially honoured the first day by manifesting himself tothem on four separate occasions (Matt. 28:9; Luke 24:34, 18-33;John 20:19-23). Again, on the next first day of the week, Jesusappeared to his disciples (John 20:26).<br><br>Some have calculated that Christ\'s ascension took place on thefirst day of the week. And there can be no doubt that thedescent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was on that day (Acts2:1). Thus Christ appears as instituting a new day to beobserved by his people as the Sabbath, a day to be henceforthknown amongst them as the \"Lord\'s day.\" The observance of this\"Lord\'s day\" as the Sabbath was the general custom of theprimitive churches, and must have had apostolic sanction (comp.Acts 20:3-7; 1 Cor. 16:1, 2) and authority, and so the sanctionand authority of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The words \"at her sabbaths\" (Lam. 1:7, A.V.) ought probably tobe, as in the Revised Version, \"at her desolations.\"<br><br>'),

It was founded on the Law, copies of which had beenmultiplied in Israel as well as in Judah. Thus the Pentateuchwas preserved among the Samaritans, although they never calledit by this name, but always \"the Law,\" which they read as onebook. The division into five books, as we now have it, however,was adopted by the Samaritans, as it was by the Jews, in alltheir priests\' copies of \"the Law,\" for the sake of convenience.This was the only portion of the Old Testament which wasaccepted by the Samaritans as of divine authority.<br><br>The form of the letters in the manuscript copies of theSamaritan Pentateuch is different from that of the Hebrewcopies, and is probably the same as that which was in generaluse before the Captivity.

Her prayer was graciously granted; and after the child wasweaned she brought him to Shiloh nd consecrated him to the Lordas a perpetual Nazarite (1:23-2:11). Here his bodily wants andtraining were attended to by the women who served in thetabernacle, while Eli cared for his religious culture. Thus,probably, twelve years of his life passed away. \"The childSamuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and alsowith men\" (2:26; comp. Luke 2:52). It was a time of great andgrowing degeneracy in Israel (Judg. 21:19-21; 1 Sam. 2:12-17,22). The Philistines, who of late had greatly increased innumber and in power, were practically masters of the country,and kept the people in subjection (1 Sam. 10:5; 13:3).<br><br>At this time new communications from God began to be made to thepious child. A mysterious voice came to him in the night season,calling him by name, and, instructed by Eli, he answered,\"Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.\" The message that camefrom the Lord was one of woe and ruin to Eli and his profligatesons. Samuel told it all to Eli, whose only answer to theterrible denunciations (1 Sam. 3:11-18) was, \"It is the Lord;let him do what seemeth him good\", the passive submission of aweak character, not, in his case, the expression of the highesttrust and faith. The Lord revealed himself now in divers mannersto Samuel, and his fame and his influence increased throughoutthe land as of one divinely called to the prophetical office. Anew period in the history of the kingdom of God now commenced.<br><br>The Philistine yoke was heavy, and the people, groaning underthe wide-spread oppression, suddenly rose in revolt, and \"wentout against the Philistines to battle.\" A fierce and disastrousbattle was fought at Aphek, near to Ebenezer (1 Sam. 4:1, 2).The Israelites were defeated, leaving 4,000 dead \"in the field.\"The chiefs of the people thought to repair this great disasterby carrying with them the ark of the covenant as the symbol ofJehovah\'s presence. They accordingly, without consulting Samuel,fetched it out of Shiloh to the camp near Aphek. At the sight ofthe ark among them the people \"shouted with a great shout, sothat the earth rang again.\" A second battle was fought, andagain the Philistines defeated the Israelites, stormed theircamp, slew 30,000 men, and took the sacred ark. The tidings ofthis fatal battle was speedily conveyed to Shiloh; and so soonas the aged Eli heard that the ark of God was taken, he fellbackward from his seat at the entrance of the sanctuary, and hisneck brake, and he died. The tabernacle with its furniture wasprobably, by the advice of Samuel, now about twenty years ofage, removed from Shiloh to some place of safety, and finally toNob, where it remained many years (21:1).<br><br>The Philistines followed up their advantage, and marched uponShiloh, which they plundered and destroyed (comp. Jer. 7:12; Ps.78:59). This was a great epoch in the history of Israel. Fortwenty years after this fatal battle at Aphek the whole land layunder the oppression of the Philistines. During all these drearyyears Samuel was a spiritual power in the land. From Ramah, hisnative place, where he resided, his influence went forth onevery side among the people. With unwearied zeal he went up anddown from place to place, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting thepeople, endeavouring to awaken in them a sense of theirsinfulness, and to lead them to repentance. His labours were sofar successful that \"all the house of Israel lamented after theLord.\" Samuel summoned the people to Mizpeh, one of the loftiesthills in Central Palestine, where they fasted and prayed, andprepared themselves there, under his direction, for a great waragainst the Philistines, who now marched their whole forcetoward Mizpeh, in order to crush the Israelites once for all. Atthe intercession of Samuel God interposed in behalf of Israel.Samuel himself was their leader, the only occasion in which heacted as a leader in war. The Philistines were utterly routed.They fled in terror before the army of Israel, and a greatslaughter ensued. This battle, fought probably about B.C. 1095,put an end to the forty years of Philistine oppression. Inmemory of this great deliverance, and in token of gratitude forthe help vouchsafed, Samuel set up a great stone in thebattlefield, and called it \"Ebenezer,\" saying, \"Hitherto haththe Lord helped us\" (1 Sam. 7:1-12). This was the spot where,twenty years before, the Israelites had suffered a great defeat,when the ark of God was taken.<br><br>This victory over the Philistines was followed by a long periodof peace for Israel (1 Sam. 7:13, 14), during which Samuelexercised the functions of judge, going \"from year to year incircuit\" from his home in Ramah to Bethel, thence to Gilgal (notthat in the Jordan valley, but that which lay to the west ofEbal and Gerizim), and returning by Mizpeh to Ramah. Heestablished regular services at Shiloh, where he built an altar;and at Ramah he gathered a company of young men around him andestablished a school of the prophets. The schools of theprophets, thus originated, and afterwards established also atGibeah, Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, exercised an importantinfluence on the national character and history of the people inmaintaining pure religion in the midst of growing corruption.They continued to the end of the Jewish commonwealth.<br><br>Many years now passed, during which Samuel exercised thefunctions of his judicial office, being the friend andcounsellor of the people in all matters of private and publicinterest. He was a great statesman as well as a reformer, andall regarded him with veneration as the \"seer,\" the prophet ofthe Lord. At the close of this period, when he was now an oldman, the elders of Israel came to him at Ramah (1 Sam. 8:4, 5,19-22); and feeling how great was the danger to which the nationwas exposed from the misconduct of Samuel\'s sons, whom he hadinvested with judicial functions as his assistants, and hadplaced at Beersheba on the Philistine border, and also from athreatened invasion of the Ammonites, they demanded that a kingshould be set over them. This request was very displeasing toSamuel. He remonstrated with them, and warned them of theconsequences of such a step. At length, however, referring thematter to God, he acceded to their desires, and anointed Saul(q.v.) to be their king (11:15). Before retiring from publiclife he convened an assembly of the people at Gilgal (ch. 12),and there solemnly addressed them with reference to his ownrelation to them as judge and prophet.<br><br>The remainder of his life he spent in retirement at Ramah, onlyoccasionally and in special circumstances appearing again inpublic (1 Sam. 13, 15) with communications from God to kingSaul. While mourning over the many evils which now fell upon thenation, he is suddenly summoned (ch. 16) to go to Bethlehem andanoint David, the son of Jesse, as king over Israel instead ofSaul. After this little is known of him till the time of hisdeath, which took place at Ramah when he was probably abouteighty years of age. \"And all Israel gathered themselvestogether, and lamented him, and buried him in his house atRamah\" (25:1), not in the house itself, but in the court orgarden of his house. (Comp. 2 Kings 21:18; 2 Chr. 33:20; 1 Kings2:34; John 19:41.)<br><br>Samuel\'s devotion to God, and the special favour with which Godregarded him, are referred to in Jer. 15:1 and Ps. 99:6.<br><br>');

The son of Kish (probably his only son, and a child ofprayer, \"asked for\"), of the tribe of Benjamin, the first kingof the Jewish nation. The singular providential circumstancesconnected with his election as king are recorded in 1 Sam. 8-10.His father\'s she-asses had strayed, and Saul was sent with aservant to seek for them. Leaving his home at Gibeah (10:5, \"thehill of God,\" A.V.; lit., as in R.V. marg., \"Gibeah of God\"),Saul and his servant went toward the north-west over MountEphraim, and then turning north-east they came to \"the land ofShalisha,\" and thence eastward to the land of Shalim, and atlength came to the district of Zuph, near Samuel\'s home at Ramah(9:5-10). At this point Saul proposed to return from the threedays\' fruitless search, but his servant suggested that theyshould first consult the \"seer.\" Hearing that he was about tooffer sacrifice, the two hastened into Ramah, and \"behold,Samuel came out against them,\" on his way to the \"bamah\", i.e.,the \"height\", where sacrifice was to be offered; and in answerto Saul\'s question, \"Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer\'shouse is,\" Samuel made himself known to him. Samuel had beendivinely prepared for his coming (9:15-17), and received Saul ashis guest. He took him with him to the sacrifice, and then afterthe feast \"communed with Saul upon the top of the house\" of allthat was in his heart. On the morrow Samuel \"took a vial of oiland poured it on his head,\" and anointed Saul as king overIsrael (9:25-10:8), giving him three signs in confirmation ofhis call to be king. When Saul reached his home in Gibeah thelast of these signs was fulfilled, and the Sprit of God cameupon him, and \"he was turned into another man.\" The simplecountryman was transformed into the king of Israel, a remarkablechange suddenly took place in his whole demeanour, and thepeople said in their astonishment, as they looked on thestalwart son of Kish, \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\", asaying which passed into a \"proverb.\" (Comp. 19:24.)<br><br>The intercourse between Saul and Samuel was as yet unknown tothe people. The \"anointing\" had been in secret. But now the timehad come when the transaction must be confirmed by the nation.Samuel accordingly summoned the people to a solemn assembly\"before the Lord\" at Mizpeh. Here the lot was drawn (10:17-27),and it fell upon Saul, and when he was presented before them,the stateliest man in all Israel, the air was rent for the firsttime in Israel by the loud cry, \"God save the king!\" He nowreturned to his home in Gibeah, attended by a kind of bodyguard,\"a band of men whose hearts God had touched.\" On reaching hishome he dismissed them, and resumed the quiet toils of hisformer life.<br><br>Soon after this, on hearing of the conduct of Nahash theAmmonite at Jabeshgilead (q.v.), an army out of all the tribesof Israel rallied at his summons to the trysting-place at Bezek,and he led them forth a great army to battle, gaining a completevictory over the Ammonite invaders at Jabesh (11:1-11). Amid theuniversal joy occasioned by this victory he was now fullyrecognized as the king of Israel. At the invitation of Samuel\"all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul kingbefore the Lord in Gilgal.\" Samuel now officially anointed himas king (11:15). Although Samuel never ceased to be a judge inIsrael, yet now his work in that capacity practically came to anend.<br><br>Saul now undertook the great and difficult enterprise of freeingthe land from its hereditary enemies the Philistines, and forthis end he gathered together an army of 3,000 men (1 Sam. 13:1,2). The Philistines were encamped at Geba. Saul, with 2,000 men,occupied Michmash and Mount Bethel; while his son Jonathan, with1,000 men, occupied Gibeah, to the south of Geba, and seeminglywithout any direction from his father \"smote\" the Philistines inGeba. Thus roused, the Philistines, who gathered an army of30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and \"people as the sandwhich is on the sea-shore in multitude,\" encamped in Michmash,which Saul had evacuated for Gilgal. Saul now tarried for sevendays in Gilgal before making any movement, as Samuel hadappointed (10:8); but becoming impatient on the seventh day, asit was drawing to a close, when he had made an end of offeringthe burnt offering, Samuel appeared and warned him of the fatalconsequences of his act of disobedience, for he had not waitedlong enough (13:13, 14).<br><br>When Saul, after Samuel\'s departure, went out from Gilgal withhis 600 men, his followers having decreased to that number(13:15), against the Philistines at Michmash (q.v.), he had hishead-quarters under a pomegrante tree at Migron, over againstMichmash, the Wady esSuweinit alone intervening. Here atGibeah-Geba Saul and his army rested, uncertain what to do.Jonathan became impatient, and with his armour-bearer planned anassault against the Philistines, unknown to Saul and the army(14:1-15). Jonathan and his armour-bearer went down into thewady, and on their hands and knees climbed to the top of thenarrow rocky ridge called Bozez, where was the outpost of thePhilistine army. They surprised and then slew twenty of thePhilistines, and immediately the whole host of the Philistineswas thrown into disorder and fled in great terror. \"It was avery great trembling;\" a supernatural panic seized the host.Saul and his 600 men, a band which speedily increased to 10,000,perceiving the confusion, pursued the army of the Philistines,and the tide of battle rolled on as far as to Bethaven, halfwaybetween Michmash and Bethel. The Philistines were totallyrouted. \"So the Lord saved Israel that day.\" While pursuing thePhilistines, Saul rashly adjured the people, saying, \"Cursed bethe man that eateth any food until evening.\" But though faintand weary, the Israelites \"smote the Philistines that day fromMichmash to Aijalon\" (a distance of from 15 to 20 miles).Jonathan had, while passing through the wood in pursuit of thePhilistines, tasted a little of the honeycomb which was abundantthere (14:27). This was afterwards discovered by Saul (ver. 42),and he threatened to put his son to death. The people, however,interposed, saying, \"There shall not one hair of his head fallto the ground.\" He whom God had so signally owned, who had\"wrought this great salvation in Israel,\" must not die. \"ThenSaul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistineswent to their own place\" (1 Sam. 14:24-46); and thus thecampaign against the Philistines came to an end. This was Saul\'ssecond great military success.<br><br>Saul\'s reign, however, continued to be one of almost constantwar against his enemies round about (14:47, 48), in all of whichhe proved victorious. The war against the Amalekites is the onlyone which is recorded at length (1 Sam. 15). These oldest andhereditary (Ex. 17:8; Num. 14:43-45) enemies of Israel occupiedthe territory to the south and south-west of Palestine. Samuelsummoned Saul to execute the \"ban\" which God had pronounced(Deut. 25:17-19) on this cruel and relentless foe of Israel. Thecup of their iniquity was now full. This command was \"the testof his moral qualification for being king.\" Saul proceeded toexecute the divine command; and gathering the people together,marched from Telaim (1 Sam. 15:4) against the Amalekites, whomhe smote \"from Havilah until thou comest to Shur,\" utterlydestroying \"all the people with the edge of the sword\", i.e.,all that fell into his hands. He was, however, guilty ofrebellion and disobedience in sparing Agag their king, and inconniving at his soldiers\' sparing the best of the sheep andcattle; and Samuel, following Saul to Gilgal, in the Jordanvalley, said unto him, \"Because thou hast rejected the word ofthe Lord, he also hath rejected thee from being king\" (15:23).The kingdom was rent from Saul and was given to another, even toDavid, whom the Lord chose to be Saul\'s successor, and whomSamuel anointed (16:1-13). From that day \"the spirit of the Lorddeparted from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubledhim.\" He and Samuel parted only to meet once again at one of theschools of the prophets.<br><br>David was now sent for as a \"cunning player on an harp\" (1 Sam.16:16, 18), to play before Saul when the evil spirit troubledhim, and thus was introduced to the court of Saul. He became agreat favourite with the king. At length David returned to hisfather\'s house and to his wonted avocation as a shepherd forperhaps some three years. The Philistines once more invaded theland, and gathered their army between Shochoh and Azekah, inEphes-dammim, on the southern slope of the valley of Elah. Sauland the men of Israel went forth to meet them, and encamped onthe northern slope of the same valley which lay between the twoarmies. It was here that David slew Goliath of Gath, thechampion of the Philistines (17:4-54), an exploit which led tothe flight and utter defeat of the Philistine army. Saul nowtook David permanently into his service (18:2); but he becamejealous of him (ver. 9), and on many occasions showed his enmitytoward him (ver. 10, 11), his enmity ripening into a purpose ofmurder which at different times he tried in vain to carry out.<br><br>After some time the Philistines \"gathered themselves together\"in the plain of Esdraelon, and pitched their camp at Shunem, onthe slope of Little Hermon; and Saul \"gathered all Israeltogether,\" and \"pitched in Gilboa\" (1 Sam. 28:3-14). Beingunable to discover the mind of the Lord, Saul, accompanied bytwo of his retinue, betook himself to the \"witch of Endor,\" some7 or 8 miles distant. Here he was overwhelmed by the startlingcommunication that was mysteriously made to him by Samuel (ver.16-19), who appeared to him. \"He fell straightway all along onthe earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel\"(ver. 20). The Philistine host \"fought against Israel: and themen of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell down slainin Mount Gilboa\" (31:1). In his despair at the disaster that hadbefallen his army, Saul \"took a sword and fell upon it.\" And thePhilistines on the morrow \"found Saul and his three sons fallenin Mount Gilboa.\" Having cut off his head, they sent it with hisweapons to Philistia, and hung up the skull in the temple ofDagon at Ashdod. They suspended his headless body, with that ofJonathan, from the walls of Bethshan. The men of Jabesh-gileadafterwards removed the bodies from this position; and havingburnt the flesh, they buried the bodies under a tree at Jabesh.The remains were, however, afterwards removed to the familysepulchre at Zelah (2 Sam. 21:13, 14).

The MS. waswrapped up in a piece of cloth, and on its being unrolled, tothe surprise and delight of the critic the very documentpresented itself which he had given up all hope of seeing. Hisobject had been to complete the fragmentary LXX. of 1844, whichhe had declared to be the most ancient of all Greek codices onvellum that are extant; but he found not only that, but a copyof the Greek New Testament attached, of the same age, andperfectly complete, not wanting a single page or paragraph.\"This precious fragment, after some negotiations, he obtainedpossession of, and conveyed it to the Emperor Alexander, whofully appreciated its importance, and caused it to be publishedas nearly as possible in facsimile, so as to exhibit correctlythe ancient handwriting.

Sin-offerings were alsopresented at the five annual festivals (Num. 28, 29), and on theoccasion of the consecration of the priests (Ex. 29:10-14, 36).As each individual, even the most private member of thecongregation, as well as the congregation at large, and the highpriest, was obliged, on being convicted by his conscience of anyparticular sin, to come with a sin-offering, we see thusimpressively disclosed the need in which every sinner stands ofthe salvation of Christ, and the necessity of making applicationto it as often as the guilt of sin renews itself upon hisconscience. This resort of faith to the perfect sacrifice ofChrist is the one way that lies open for the sinner\'s attainmentof pardon and restoration to peace. And then in the sacrificeitself there is the reality of that incomparable worth andpreciousness which were so significantly represented in thesin-offering by the sacredness of its blood and the halloweddestination of its flesh.

(3473, 'Solomon', 'Peaceful, (Heb. Shelomoh), David\'s second son by Bathsheba,i.e., the first after their legal marriage (2 Sam. 12). He wasprobably born about B.C. 1035 (1 Chr. 22:5; 29:1). He succeededhis father on the throne in early manhood, probably aboutsixteen or eighteen years of age. Nathan, to whom his educationwas intrusted, called him Jedidiah, i.e., \"beloved of the Lord\"(2 Sam. 12:24, 25). He was the first king of Israel \"born in thepurple.\" His father chose him as his successor, passing over theclaims of his elder sons: \"Assuredly Solomon my son shall reignafter me.\" His history is recorded in 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chr.1-9. His elevation to the throne took place before his father\'sdeath, and was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba, inconsequence of the rebellion of Adonijah (1 Kings 1:5-40).During his long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy gainedits highest splendour. This period has well been called the\"Augustan age\" of the Jewish annals. The first half of his reignwas, however, by far the brighter and more prosperous; thelatter half was clouded by the idolatries into which he fell,mainly from his heathen intermarriages (1 Kings 11:1-8; 14:21,31).<br><br>Before his death David gave parting instructions to his son (1Kings 2:1-9; 1 Chr. 22:7-16; 28). As soon as he had settledhimself in his kingdom, and arranged the affairs of hisextensive empire, he entered into an alliance with Egypt by themarriage of the daughter of Pharaoh (1 Kings 3:1), of whom,however, nothing further is recorded. He surrounded himself withall the luxuries and the external grandeur of an Easternmonarch, and his government prospered. He entered into analliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, who in many ways greatlyassisted him in his numerous undertakings. (See [599]HIRAM.)<br><br>For some years before his death David was engaged in the activework of collecting materials (1 Chr. 29:6-9; 2 Chr. 2:3-7) forbuilding a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent abode for the arkof the covenant. He was not permitted to build the house of God(1 Chr. 22:8); that honour was reserved to his son Solomon. (See[600]TEMPLE.)<br><br>After the completion of the temple, Solomon engaged in theerection of many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem andin other parts of his kingdom. For the long space of thirteenyears he was engaged in the erection of a royal palace on Ophel(1 Kings 7:1-12). It was 100 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high.Its lofty roof was supported by forty-five cedar pillars, sothat the hall was like a forest of cedar wood, and henceprobably it received the name of \"The House of the Forest ofLebanon.\" In front of this \"house\" was another building, whichwas called the Porch of Pillars, and in front of this again wasthe \"Hall of Judgment,\" or Throne-room (1 Kings 7:7; 10:18-20; 2Chr. 9:17-19), \"the King\'s Gate,\" where he administered justiceand gave audience to his people. This palace was a building ofgreat magnificence and beauty. A portion of it was set apart asthe residence of the queen consort, the daughter of Pharaoh.From the palace there was a private staircase of red and scentedsandal wood which led up to the temple.<br><br>Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securinga plentiful supply of water for the city (Eccl. 2:4-6). He thenbuilt Millo (LXX., \"Acra\") for the defence of the city,completing a line of ramparts around it (1 Kings 9:15, 24;11:27). He erected also many other fortifications for thedefence of his kingdom at various points where it was exposed tothe assault of enemies (1 Kings 9:15-19; 2 Chr. 8:2-6). Amonghis great undertakings must also be mentioned the building ofTadmor (q.v.) in the wilderness as a commercial depot, as wellas a military outpost.<br><br>During his reign Palestine enjoyed great commercial prosperity.Extensive traffic was carried on by land with Tyre and Egypt andArabia, and by sea with Spain and India and the coasts ofAfrica, by which Solomon accumulated vast stores of wealth andof the produce of all nations (1 Kings 9:26-28; 10:11, 12; 2Chr. 8:17, 18; 9:21). This was the \"golden age\" of Israel. Theroyal magnificence and splendour of Solomon\'s court wereunrivalled. He had seven hundred wives and three hundredconcubines, an evidence at once of his pride, his wealth, andhis sensuality. The maintenance of his household involvedimmense expenditure. The provision required for one day was\"thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and anhundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, andfatted fowl\" (1 Kings 4:22, 23).<br><br>Solomon\'s reign was not only a period of great materialprosperity, but was equally remarkable for its intellectualactivity. He was the leader of his people also in this uprisingamongst them of new intellectual life. \"He spake three thousandproverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spakeof trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto thehyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts,and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes\" (1 Kings4:32, 33).<br><br>His fame was spread abroad through all lands, and men came fromfar and near \"to hear the wisdom of Solomon.\" Among others thusattracted to Jerusalem was \"the queen of the south\" (Matt.12:42), the queen of Sheba, a country in Arabia Felix. \"Deep,indeed, must have been her yearning, and great his fame, whichinduced a secluded Arabian queen to break through the immemorialcustom of her dreamy land, and to put forth the energy requiredfor braving the burdens and perils of so long a journey across awilderness. Yet this she undertook, and carried it out withsafety.\" (1 Kings 10:1-13; 2 Chr. 9:1-12.) She was filled withamazement by all she saw and heard: \"there was no more spirit inher.\" After an interchange of presents she returned to hernative land.<br><br>But that golden age of Jewish history passed away. The brightday of Solomon\'s glory ended in clouds and darkness. His declineand fall from his high estate is a sad record. Chief among thecauses of his decline were his polygamy and his great wealth.\"As he grew older he spent more of his time among hisfavourites. The idle king living among these idle women, for1,000 women, with all their idle and mischievous attendants,filled the palaces and pleasure-houses which he had built (1Kings 11:3), learned first to tolerate and then to imitate theirheathenish ways. He did not, indeed, cease to believe in the Godof Israel with his mind. He did not cease to offer the usualsacrifices in the temple at the great feasts. But his heart wasnot right with God; his worship became merely formal; his soul,left empty by the dying out of true religious fervour, sought tobe filled with any religious excitement which offered itself.Now for the first time a worship was publicly set up amongst thepeople of the Lord which was not simply irregular or forbidden,like that of Gideon (Judg. 8:27), or the Danites (Judg. 18:30,31), but was downright idolatrous.\" (1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings23:13.)<br><br>This brought upon him the divine displeasure. His enemiesprevailed against him (1 Kings 11:14-22, 23-25, 26-40), and onejudgment after another fell upon the land. And now the end ofall came, and he died, after a reign of forty years, and wasburied in the city of David, and \"with him was buried theshort-lived glory and unity of Israel.\" \"He leaves behind himbut one weak and worthless son, to dismember his kingdom anddisgrace his name.\"<br><br>\"The kingdom of Solomon,\" says Rawlinson, \"is one of the moststriking facts in the Biblical history. A petty nation, whichfor hundreds of years has with difficulty maintained a separateexistence in the midst of warlike tribes, each of which has inturn exercised dominion over it and oppressed it, is suddenlyraised by the genius of a soldier-monarch to glory andgreatness. An empire is established which extends from theEuphrates to the borders of Egypt, a distance of 450 miles; andthis empire, rapidly constructed, enters almost immediately on aperiod of peace which lasts for half a century. Wealth,grandeur, architectural magnificence, artistic excellence,commercial enterprise, a position of dignity among the greatnations of the earth, are enjoyed during this space, at the endof which there is a sudden collapse.

The building had suffered considerablyfrom natural decay as well as from the assaults of hostilearmies, and Herod, desirous of gaining the favour of the Jews,proposed to rebuild it. This offer was accepted, and the workwas begun (B.C. 18), and carried out at great labour andexpense, and on a scale of surpassing splendour. The main partof the building was completed in ten years, but the erection ofthe outer courts and the embellishment of the whole were carriedon during the entire period of our Lord\'s life on earth (John2:16, 19-21), and the temple was completed only A.D. 65. But itwas not long permitted to exist. Within forty years after ourLord\'s crucifixion, his prediction of its overthrow wasaccomplished (Luke 19: 41-44).

It had two courts, oneintended for the Israelites only, and the other, a large outercourt, called \"the court of the Gentiles,\" intended for the useof strangers of all nations. These two courts were separated bya low wall, as Josephus states, some 4 1/2 feet high, withthirteen openings. Along the top of this dividing wall, atregular intervals, were placed pillars bearing in Greek aninscription to the effect that no stranger was, on the pain ofdeath, to pass from the court of the Gentiles into that of theJews. At the entrance to a graveyard at the north-western angleof the Haram wall, a stone was discovered by M. Ganneau in 1871,built into the wall, bearing the following inscription in Greekcapitals: \"No stranger is to enter within the partition wall andenclosure around the sanctuary.

It was thethreshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. The exact position onthis \"sacred enclosure\" which the temple occupied has not beenyet definitely ascertained. Some affirm that Herod\'s templecovered the site of Solomon\'s temple and palace, and in additionenclosed a square of 300 feet at the south-western angle. Thetemple courts thus are supposed to have occupied the southernportion of the \"enclosure,\" forming in all a square of more than900 feet.

(3612, 'Temple, Solomon\'s', 'Before his death David had \"with all his might\" providedmaterials in great abundance for the building of the temple onthe summit of Mount Moriah (1 Chr. 22:14; 29:4; 2 Chr. 3:1), onthe east of the city, on the spot where Abraham had offered upIsaac (Gen. 22:1-14). In the beginning of his reign Solomon setabout giving effect to the desire that had been so earnestlycherished by his father, and prepared additional materials forthe building. From subterranean quarries at Jerusalem heobtained huge blocks of stone for the foundations and walls ofthe temple. These stones were prepared for their places in thebuilding under the eye of Tyrian master-builders. He alsoentered into a compact with Hiram II., king of Tyre, for thesupply of whatever else was needed for the work, particularlytimber from the forests of Lebanon, which was brought in greatrafts by the sea to Joppa, whence it was dragged to Jerusalem (1Kings 5). As the hill on which the temple was to be built didnot afford sufficient level space, a huge wall of solid masonryof great height, in some places more than 200 feet high, wasraised across the south of the hill, and a similar wall on theeastern side, and in the spaces between were erected many archesand pillars, thus raising up the general surface to the requiredlevel. Solomon also provided for a sufficient water supply forthe temple by hewing in the rocky hill vast cisterns, into whichwater was conveyed by channels from the \"pools\" near Bethlehem.One of these cisterns, the \"great sea,\" was capable ofcontaining three millions of gallons. The overflow was led offby a conduit to the Kidron.<br><br>In all these preparatory undertakings a space of about threeyears was occupied; and now the process of the erection of thegreat building began, under the direction of skilled Phoenicianbuilders and workmen, in the fourth year of Solomon\'s reign, 480years after the Exodus (1 Kings 6; 2 Chr. 3). Many thousands oflabourers and skilled artisans were employed in the work. Stonesprepared in the quarries underneath the city (1 Kings 5:17, 18)of huge dimension (see [625]QUARRIES) were gradually placed onthe massive walls, and closely fitted together without anymortar between, till the whole structure was completed. No soundof hammer or axe or any tool of iron was heard as the structurearose (6:7). \"Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprang.\"The building was 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubitshigh. The engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, in theirexplorations around the temple area, discovered what is believedto have been the \"chief corner stone\" of the temple, \"the mostinteresting stone in the world.\" It lies at the bottom of thesouth-eastern angle, and is 3 feet 8 inches high by 14 feetlong. It rests on the solid rock at a depth of 79 feet 3 inchesbelow the present surface. (See [626]PINNACLE.) In examining thewalls the engineers were \"struck with admiration at the vastnessof the blocks and the general excellence of the workmanship.\"<br><br>At length, in the autumn of the eleventh year of his reign,seven and a half years after it had been begun, the temple wascompleted in all its architectural magnificence and beauty. Forthirteen years there it stood, on the summit of Moriah, silentand unused. The reasons for this strange delay in itsconsecration are unknown. At the close of these thirteen yearspreparations for the dedication of the temple were made on ascale of the greatest magnificence. The ark was solemnly broughtfrom the tent in which David had deposited it to the placeprepared for it in the temple, and the glory-cloud, the symbolof the divine presence, filled the house. Then Solomon ascendeda platform which had been erected for him, in the sight of allthe people, and lifting up his hands to heaven poured out hisheart to God in prayer (1 Kings 8; 2 Chr. 6, 7). The feast ofdedication, which lasted seven days, followed by the feast oftabernacles, marked a new era in the history of Israel. On theeighth day of the feast of tabernacles, Solomon dismissed thevast assemblage of the people, who returned to their homesfilled with joy and gladness, \"Had Solomon done no other servicebeyond the building of the temple, he would still haveinfluenced the religious life of his people down to the latestdays.

It was floored and wainscotted with cedar(1 Kings 6:16), and its walls and floor were overlaid with gold(6:20, 21, 30). There was a two-leaved door between it and theholy place overlaid with gold (2 Chr. 4:22); also a veil of bluepurple and crimson and fine linen (2 Chr. 3:14; comp. Ex.26:33). It had no windows (1 Kings 8:12). It was indeed thedwelling-place of God. (2.) The holy place (q.v.), 1 Kings8:8-10, called also the \"greater house\" (2 Chr. 3:5) and the\"temple\" (1 Kings 6:17). (3.) The porch or entrance before thetemple on the east (1 Kings 6:3; 2 Chr. 3:4; 29:7). In the porchstood the two pillars Jachin and Boaz (1 Kings 7:21; 2 Kings11:14; 23:3). (4.) The chambers, which were built about thetemple on the southern, western, and northern sides (1 Kings6:5-10). These formed a part of the building.<br><br>Round about the building were, (1.) The court of the priests (2Chr. 4:9), called the \"inner court\" (1 Kings 6:36). It containedthe altar of burnt-offering (2 Chr. 15:8), the brazen sea(4:2-5, 10), and ten lavers (1 Kings 7:38, 39). (2.) The greatcourt, which surrounded the whole temple (2 Chr. 4:9).

(3613, 'Temple, the Second', 'After the return from captivity, under Zerubbabel (q.v.) and thehigh priest Jeshua, arrangements were almost immediately made toreorganize the long-desolated kingdom. The body of pilgrims,forming a band of 42,360, including children, having completedthe long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banksof the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated in all theirproceeding by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one oftheir first cares was to restore their ancient worship byrebuilding the temple. On the invitation of Zerubbabel, thegovernor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality bycontributing personally 1,000 golden darics (probably about$6,000), besides other gifts, the people with great enthusiasmpoured their gifts into the sacred treasury (Ezra 2). First theyerected and dedicated the altar of Jehovah on the exact spotwhere it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away thecharred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the oldtemple; and in the second month of the second year (B.C. 535),amid great public excitement and rejoicing (Ps. 116; 117; 118),the foundations of the second temple were laid. A wide interestwas felt in this great movement, although it was regarded withmingled feelings by the spectators (Hag. 2:3; Zech. 4:10). TheSamaritans made proposals for a co-operation in the work.Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the elders, however, declined all suchcooperation: Judah must build the temple without help.Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. TheSamaritans sought to \"frustrate their purpose\" (Ezra 4:5), andsent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that thework was suspended. Seven years after this Cyrus diedingloriously, having killed himself in Syria when on his wayback from Egypt to the east, and was succeeded by his sonCambyses (B.C. 529-522), on whose death the \"false Smerdis,\" animposter, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months,and then Darius Hystaspes became king (B.C. 522). In the secondyear of this monarch the work of rebuilding the temple wasresumed and carried forward to its completion (Ezra 5: 6-17;6:1-15), under the stimulus of the earnest counsels andadmonitions of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. It was readyfor consecration in the spring of B.C. 516, twenty years afterthe return from captivity.<br><br>This second temple had not the ark, the Urim and Thummim, theholy oil, the sacred fire, the tables of stone, the pot ofmanna, and Aaron\'s rod.

The second templealso had for the first time a space, being a part of the outercourt, provided for proselytes who were worshippers of Jehovah,although not subject to the laws of Judaism.<br><br>The temple, when completed, was consecrated amid greatrejoicings on the part of all the people (Ezra 6:16), althoughthere were not wanting outward evidences that the Jews were nolonger an independent people, but were subject to a foreignpower.<br><br>Hag. 2:9 is rightly rendered in the Revised Version, \"The latterglory of this house shall be greater than the former,\" insteadof, \"The glory of this latter house,\" etc., in the AuthorizedVersion.

The glory here predicted is spiritual glory andnot material splendour. \"Christ himself, present bodily in thetemple on Mount Zion during his life on earth, presentspiritually in the Church now, present in the holy city, theheavenly Jerusalem, of which he is the temple, calling forthspiritual worship and devotion is the glory here predicted\"(Perowne).<br><br>'),
(3614, 'Temptation', '(1.) Trial; a being put to the test. Thus God \"tempted [Gen. 22:1; R.V., did prove\'] Abraham;\" and afflictions are said totempt, i.e., to try, men (James 1:2, 12; comp. Deut. 8:2),putting their faith and patience to the test. (2.) Ordinarily,however, the word means solicitation to that which is evil, andhence Satan is called \"the tempter\" (Matt. 4:3). Our Lord was inthis way tempted in the wilderness. That temptation was notinternal, but by a real, active, subtle being. It was notself-sought. It was submitted to as an act of obedience on hispart. \"Christ was led, driven. An unseen personal force bore hima certain violence is implied in the words\" (Matt. 4:1-11).<br><br>The scene of the temptation of our Lord is generally supposed tohave been the mountain of Quarantania (q.v.), \"a high andprecipitous wall of rock, 1,200 or 1,500 feet above the plainwest of Jordan, near Jericho.\"<br><br>Temptation is common to all (Dan. 12:10; Zech. 13:9; Ps. 66:10;Luke 22:31, 40; Heb. 11:17; James 1:12; 1 Pet. 1:7; 4:12).

Tents havealways occupied a prominent place in Eastern life (1 Sam. 17:54;2 Kings 7:7; Ps. 120:5; Cant. 1:5).

She pointed itout to the soldiers, and alleged that David was confined to hisbed by a sudden illness (1 Sam. 19:13-16). Thus she gained timefor David\'s escape. It seems strange to read of teraphim, imagesof ancestors, preserved for superstitious purposes, being in thehouse of David. Probably they had been stealthily brought byMichal from her father\'s house. \"Perhaps,\" says BishopWordsworth, \"Saul, forsaken by God and possessed by the evilspirit, had resorted to teraphim (as he afterwards resorted towitchcraft); and God overruled evil for good, and made his veryteraphim (by the hand of his own daughter) to be an instrumentfor David\'s escape.\", Deane\'s David, p. 32.

(3768, 'Version', 'A translation of the holy Scriptures. This word is not found inthe Bible, nevertheless, as frequent references are made in thiswork to various ancient as well as modern versions, it isfitting that some brief account should be given of the mostimportant of these. These versions are important helps to theright interpretation of the Word. (See SAMARITAN[653]PENTATEUCH.)<br><br>1. The Targums. After the return from the Captivity, the Jews,no longer familiar with the old Hebrew, required that theirScriptures should be translated for them into the Chaldaic orAramaic language and interpreted. These translations andparaphrases were at first oral, but they were afterwards reducedto writing, and thus targums, i.e., \"versions\" or\"translations\", have come down to us. The chief of these are,(1.) The Onkelos Targum, i.e., the targum of Akelas=Aquila, atargum so called to give it greater popularity by comparing itwith the Greek translation of Aquila mentioned below. Thistargum originated about the second century after Christ. (2.)The targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel comes next to that of Onkelosin respect of age and value. It is more a paraphrase on theProphets, however, than a translation. Both of these targumsissued from the Jewish school which then flourished at Babylon.<br><br>2. The Greek Versions. (1.) The oldest of these is theSeptuagint, usually quoted as the LXX. The origin of this themost important of all the versions is involved in muchobscurity. It derives its name from the popular notion thatseventy-two translators were employed on it by the direction ofPtolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and that it wasaccomplished in seventy-two days, for the use of the Jewsresiding in that country. There is no historical warrant forthis notion. It is, however, an established fact that thisversion was made at Alexandria; that it was begun about 280B.C., and finished about 200 or 150 B.C.; that it was the workof a number of translators who differed greatly both in theirknowledge of Hebrew and of Greek; and that from the earliesttimes it has borne the name of \"The Septuagint\", i.e., TheSeventy.<br><br>\"This version, with all its defects, must be of the greatestinterest, (a) as preserving evidence for the text far moreancient than the oldest Hebrew manuscripts; (b) as the means bywhich the Greek Language was wedded to Hebrew thought; (c) asthe source of the great majority of quotations from the OldTestament by writers of the New Testament.<br><br>(2.) The New Testament manuscripts fall into two divisions,Uncials, written in Greek capitals, with no distinction at allbetween the different words, and very little even between thedifferent lines; and Cursives, in small Greek letters, and withdivisions of words and lines. The change between the two kindsof Greek writing took place about the tenth century. Only fivemanuscripts of the New Testament approaching to completeness aremore ancient than this dividing date. The first, numbered A, isthe Alexandrian manuscript. Though brought to this country byCyril Lucar, patriarch of Constantinople, as a present toCharles I., it is believed that it was written, not in thatcapital, but in Alexandria; whence its title. It is now dated inthe fifth century A.D. The second, known as B, is the Vaticanmanuscript. (See [654]VATICANUS.) The Third, C, or the Ephraemmanuscript, was so called because it was written over thewritings of Ephraem, a Syrian theological author, a practicevery common in the days when writing materials were scarce anddear. It is believed that it belongs to the fifth century, andperhaps a slightly earlier period of it than the manuscript A.The fourth, D, or the manuscript of Beza, was so called becauseit belonged to the reformer Beza, who found it in the monasteryof St. Irenaeus at Lyons in 1562 A.D. It is imperfect, and isdated in the sixth century. The fifth (called Aleph) is theSinaitic manuscript. (See [655]SINAITICUS.)<br><br>3. The Syriac Versions. (See [656]SYRIAC.)<br><br>4. The Latin Versions. A Latin version of the Scriptures, calledthe \"Old Latin,\" which originated in North Africa, was in commonuse in the time of Tertullian (A.D. 150). Of this there appearto have been various copies or recensions made. That made inItaly, and called the Itala, was reckoned the most accurate.This translation of the Old Testament seems to have been madenot from the original Hebrew but from the LXX.<br><br>This version became greatly corrupted by repeated transcription,and to remedy the evil Jerome (A.D. 329-420) was requested byDamasus, the bishop of Rome, to undertake a complete revision ofit. It met with opposition at first, but was at length, in theseventh century, recognized as the \"Vulgate\" version. Itappeared in a printed from about A.D. 1455, the first book thatever issued from the press. The Council of Trent (1546) declaredit \"authentic.\" It subsequently underwent various revisions, butthat which was executed (1592) under the sanction of PopeClement VIII. was adopted as the basis of all subsequenteditions. It is regarded as the sacred original in the RomanCatholic Church. All modern European versions have been more orless influenced by the Vulgate. This version reads ipsa_ insteadof _ipse in Gen. 3:15, \"She shall bruise thy head.\"<br><br>5. There are several other ancient versions which are ofimportance for Biblical critics, but which we need not mentionparticularly, such as the Ethiopic, in the fourth century, fromthe LXX.; two Egyptian versions, about the fourth century, theMemphitic, circulated in Lower Egypt, and the Thebaic, designedfor Upper Egypt, both from the Greek; the Gothic, written in theGerman language, but with the Greek alphabet, by Ulphilas (diedA.D. 388), of which only fragments of the Old Testament remain;the Armenian, about A.D. 400; and the Slavonic, in the ninthcentury, for ancient Moravia. Other ancient versions, as theArabic, the Persian, and the Anglo-Saxon, may be mentioned.<br><br>6. The history of the English versions begins properly withWyckliffe. Portions, however, of the Scriptures were renderedinto Saxon (as the Gospel according to John, by Bede, A.D. 735),and also into English (by Orme, called the \"Ormulum,\" a portionof the Gospels and of the Acts in the form of a metricalparaphrase, toward the close of the seventh century), longbefore Wyckliffe; but it is to him that the honour belongs ofhaving first rendered the whole Bible into English (A.D. 1380).This version was made from the Vulgate, and renders Gen. 3:15after that Version, \"She shall trede thy head.\"<br><br>This was followed by Tyndale\'s translation (1525-1531); MilesCoverdale\'s (1535-1553); Thomas Matthew\'s (1537), really,however, the work of John Rogers, the first martyr under thereign of Queen Mary. This was properly the first AuthorizedVersion, Henry VIII. having ordered a copy of it to be got forevery church. This took place in less than a year after Tyndalewas martyred for the crime of translating the Scriptures. In1539 Richard Taverner published a revised edition of Matthew\'sBible. The Great Bible, so called from its great size, calledalso Cranmer\'s Bible, was published in 1539 and 1568. In thestrict sense, the \"Great Bible\" is \"the only authorized version;for the Bishops\' Bible and the present Bible [the A.V.] neverhad the formal sanction of royal authority.\" Next in order wasthe Geneva version (1557-1560); the Bishops\' Bible (1568); theRheims and Douai versions, under Roman Catholic auspices (1582,1609); the Authorized Version (1611); and the Revised Version ofthe New Testament in 1880 and of the Old Testament in 1884.<br><br>'),

This wind prevails inPalestine from February to June, as the west wind (Luke 12:54)does from November to February. The south was a hot wind (Job37:17; Luke 12:55). It swept over the Arabian peninsula. Therush of invaders is figuratively spoken of as a whirlwind (Isa.21:1); a commotion among the nations of the world as a strivingof the four winds (Dan. 7:2).

Tirosh, properly \"must,\" translated \"wine\" (Deut. 28:51);\"new wine\" (Prov. 3:10); \"sweet wine\" (Micah 6:15; R.V.,\"vintage\"). This Hebrew word has been traced to a root meaning\"to take possession of\" and hence it is supposed that tirosh isso designated because in intoxicating it takes possession of thebrain. Among the blessings promised to Esau (Gen. 27:28) mentionis made of \"plenty of corn and tirosh.\" Palestine is called \"aland of corn and tirosh\" (Deut. 33:28; comp. Isa. 36:17).
